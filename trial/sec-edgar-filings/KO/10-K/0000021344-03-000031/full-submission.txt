                                     PART I
                                     ------

ITEM 1. BUSINESS
- ----------------

     The Coca-Cola Company is the largest manufacturer, distributor and marketer
of nonalcoholic beverage concentrates and syrups in the world. Finished beverage
products  bearing our trademarks,  sold in the United States since 1886, are now
sold in more than 200 countries  and include the leading soft drink  products in
most of these  countries.  When used in this report,  the terms "Company," "we,"
"us" or "our" mean The Coca-Cola Company and its divisions and subsidiaries.

     Our business is nonalcoholic  beverages -- principally  soft drinks (1) but
also  a  variety  of  noncarbonated   beverages.(2)   We  manufacture   beverage
concentrates and syrups,  as well as some finished  beverages,  which we sell to
bottling and canning  operations,  distributors,  fountain  wholesalers and some
fountain  retailers.  We also market and distribute  juices and juice drinks and
certain water  products.  In addition,  we have ownership  interests in numerous
bottling and canning operations.

     We were incorporated in September 1919 under the laws of the State of
Delaware and succeeded to the business of a Georgia corporation with the same
name that had been organized in 1892.

     Our Company is one of numerous competitors in the commercial beverages
market. Of the approximately 50 billion beverage servings of all types consumed
worldwide every day, beverages bearing our trademarks ("Company Trademark
Beverages") account for more than 1.2 billion.

     We believe that our success depends on our ability to connect with
consumers by creating brands they love. It further depends on the capacity of
our people, together with our bottling partners, to find new and appealing ways
to deliver those brands to thirsty people everywhere. Our Company has adopted an
approach to its business that is based on the following strategic priorities:

     - Accelerate carbonated soft-drink growth, led by Coca-Cola
     - Selectively broaden our family of beverage brands to drive profitable
       growth
     - Grow system profitability and capability together with our bottling
       partners
     - Serve customers with creativity and consistency to generate growth across
       all channels
     - Direct investments to highest-potential areas across markets
     - Drive efficiency and cost effectiveness everywhere

     The Company's operating structure includes the following operating
segments, the first five of which are also sometimes referred to as strategic
business units:

     - North America
     - Africa
     - Europe, Eurasia and Middle East
     - Latin America
     - Asia
     - Corporate

This structure is the basis for our Company's internal financial reporting.  The
North  America  segment  includes  the United  States,  Canada and Puerto  Rico.
Effective January 1, 2001, the Company's operating segments were

- ------------------

(1)  As used  in this  report,  the  term  "soft  drinks"  means  nonalcoholic
carbonated  beverages  containing  flavorings and sweeteners,  excluding waters,
flavored waters and carbonated or noncarbonated teas, coffees and sports drinks.

(2)  As  used  in  this  report,  the  term  "noncarbonated  beverages"  means
nonalcoholic  noncarbonated beverages including,  but not limited to, waters and
flavored waters, juices and juice-based  beverages,  sports drinks, and teas and
coffees.

                                       1

geographically  reconfigured and renamed. At that time, Puerto Rico was added to
the North  America  segment  from the Latin  America  segment.  The Middle  East
Division was added to the Europe and Eurasia segment,  which changed its name to
the Europe,  Eurasia and Middle East segment.  At the same time,  the Africa and
Middle East segment,  less the  reclassified  Middle East Division,  changed its
name to the Africa  segment.  During the first quarter of 2001, the Asia Pacific
segment was  renamed the Asia  segment.  During the first  quarter of 2002,  the
Egypt Region was reclassified  from the Europe,  Eurasia and Middle East segment
to the Africa segment.

     At the date of this report,  the heads of the strategic  business units are
as follows:  Alexander B. Cummings, Jr. (Africa), Mary E. Minnick (Asia), A.R.C.
"Sandy"  Allan  (Europe,  Eurasia and Middle  East),  Jose Octavio  Reyes (Latin
America) and Jeffrey T. Dunn (North America). See "Item X. -- Executive Officers
of the Company." The heads of the strategic  business  units report to Steven J.
Heyer,  President and Chief  Operating  Officer of the Company.  Steven J. Heyer
reports  to  Douglas  N.  Daft,  Chairman  of the Board of  Directors  and Chief
Executive Officer of the Company.

     Except to the  extent  that  differences  between  operating  segments  are
material to an  understanding  of our business taken as a whole, the description
of our business in this report is presented on a consolidated basis.

     In the following  table,  prior period  amounts have been  reclassified  to
conform to the current  period  presentation.  Information  about our  Company's
operations  for the years ended  December 31, 2002,  2001 and 2000, by operating
segment, is as follows (in millions):

For additional financial information about our operating segments and geographic
areas, see Notes 1 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, set forth on
pages 77-81 and 104-106,  respectively, of our Annual Report to Share Owners for
the year ended December 31, 2002, incorporated herein by reference.

     Our Company  manufactures and sells soft drink and  noncarbonated  beverage
concentrates  (sometimes  referred to as beverage  bases) and syrups,  including
fountain  syrups.  We also  manufacture and sell some finished  beverages,  both
carbonated and noncarbonated,  including certain juice and juice-drink  products
and water products.

     Syrups are composed of sweetener, water and flavoring concentrate.  We sell
the  concentrates  and syrups for bottled  and canned  beverages  to  authorized
bottling and canning operations. In addition to concentrates and syrups for soft
drink products and flavored noncarbonated  beverages,  we also sell concentrates
for purified water products such as Dasani to authorized bottling operations.

                                       2
<PAGE>

     The bottlers or canners of  soft-drink  products  either  combine the syrup
with  carbonated  water or combine the  concentrate  with  sweetener,  water and
carbonated water to produce  finished soft drinks.  The finished soft drinks are
packaged  in  authorized  containers  bearing  our  trademarks  -- such as cans,
refillable and non-refillable  glass and plastic bottles -- and are then sold to
retailers or, in some cases,  wholesalers.  Principally in the United States, we
manufacture  fountain syrups and sell these to authorized  fountain  wholesalers
and some  fountain  retailers.  (Outside  the  United  States,  fountain  syrups
typically are manufactured by authorized bottlers from concentrates sold to them
by the Company.) Authorized fountain  wholesalers  (including certain authorized
bottlers) sell fountain syrups to fountain retailers. The fountain retailers use
dispensing  equipment to mix the syrup with  carbonated  or still water and then
sell  finished soft drinks or  noncarbonated  beverages to consumers in cups and
glasses.

     Finished beverages  manufactured by us comprise a variety of carbonated and
noncarbonated  beverages.  Most of these  finished  beverages  are sold by us to
authorized  bottlers  or  distributors,  who in  turn  sell  these  products  to
retailers or, in some cases, wholesalers. Both directly and through a network of
business partners,  including certain Coca-Cola  bottlers,  Company-manufactured
juice and  juice-drink  products  and certain  water  products are sold by us to
retailers and wholesalers in the United States and numerous other countries.

     The  Company's  beverage  products  include  bottled  and canned  beverages
produced by independent and Company-owned  bottling and canning  operations,  as
well as concentrates,  syrups and some  non-ready-to-drink  powder products. Our
beverage products include Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola classic, caffeine free Coca-Cola,
caffeine free Coca-Cola classic,  diet Coke (sold under the trademark  Coca-Cola
light in many countries other than the United States),  caffeine free diet Coke,
diet Coke with lemon,  Vanilla Coke, diet Vanilla Coke, Cherry Coke, diet Cherry
Coke,  Fanta brand soft drinks,  Sprite,  diet Sprite (sold under the  trademark
Sprite light in many countries  other than the United States),  Mr. Pibb,  Mello
Yello,  TAB,  Fresca,  Barq's  root beer and  other  flavors,  Citra,  POWERade,
Fruitopia,  Minute Maid flavors,  Aquarius,  Sokenbicha,  Ciel, Bonaqa,  Dasani,
Lift, Thums Up, Kinley, Pop, Kuat, Qoo and other products developed for specific
countries,  including Georgia brand  ready-to-drink  coffees, and numerous other
brands.  In many  countries  (excluding  the United  States,  among  others) our
Company's  beverage products also include  Schweppes,  Canada Dry, Dr Pepper and
Crush.  Our Company  produces,  distributes  and markets  juice and  juice-drink
products,  including Minute Maid products,  Simply Orange orange juice,  Odwalla
and Samantha super premium juices and drinks, Five Alive refreshment  beverages,
Bacardi  tropical fruit mixers  (manufactured  and marketed under a license from
Bacardi & Company  Limited),  and Hi-C  ready-to-serve  fruit  drinks.  Beverage
Partners  Worldwide,  the  Company's  50% owned joint  venture with Nestle S.A.,
markets ready-to-drink teas and coffees in certain countries. Our Company is the
exclusive  master  distributor  of Evian  bottled water in the United States and
Canada. In addition,  CCDA Waters, L.L.C., a 51% owned consolidated  subsidiary,
has a license  for the use of the  Dannon  and  Sparkletts  water  brands in the
United States.

     Consumer demand  determines the optimal menu of Company product  offerings.
Consumer  demand can vary from one locale to  another  and can change  over time
within a single locale.  Employing our business strategy, and with special focus
on Coca-Cola,  our Company  seeks to build its existing  brands and, at the same
time, to broaden its historical family of brands, products and services in order
to create and satisfy consumer demand locale by locale.

     Our Company  introduced a variety of new brands and  products  during 2002.
Vanilla  Coke  was  rolled  out  initially  in the  United  States  and  Canada,
commencing in May. In October,  diet Vanilla Coke was introduced in the same two
countries.   Vanilla  Coke  also  was  introduced  in  other  markets  including
Australia,  New Zealand and Nordic  markets  during  2002,  with more  countries
planning launches for 2003. Diet Coke with lemon/Coca-Cola  light with lemon was
rolled  out  in  20  new   international   markets.   Among  other  new  product
introductions, Love Body diet tea was introduced in Japan.

     During 2002, we acquired certain brands or license rights for brands. These
included  Risco  water in Mexico,  Dorna water and Valser  water in Europe,  the
Seagram's mixers line of soft drinks, and Rio Beverages in New Zealand.

     Also during 2002,  our Company  broadened its  collaboration  with The Walt
Disney Company to market noncarbonated children's beverages.

                                       3

     Our Company  measures  sales  volume in two ways:  (1) gallons and (2) unit
cases of finished products. "Gallons" is a unit of measurement for concentrates,
syrups,  beverage bases, finished beverages and powders (in all cases, expressed
in equivalent  gallons of syrup) for all beverage  products which are reportable
as unit case volume. Most of our revenues are based on this measure of primarily
"wholesale"  activity.  We also  measure  volume in unit cases.  As used in this
report,  "unit case" means a unit of measurement  equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces
of finished  beverage (24 eight-ounce  servings);  and "unit case volume" of the
Company  means the  number of unit cases (or unit case  equivalents)  of Company
trademark  or licensed  beverage  products  directly or  indirectly  sold by the
Coca-Cola bottling system or by the Company to customers.  This volume primarily
consists of beverage products bearing Company trademarks.  Also included in unit
case volume are certain  products  licensed to our Company or owned by Coca-Cola
system bottlers,  for which our Company provides  marketing  support and derives
profit  from the  sales.  Such  products  licensed  to our  Company  or owned by
Coca-Cola  system  bottlers  account  for a minimal  portion  of total unit case
volume.  Although most of our Company's  revenues are not based directly on unit
case  volume,  we  believe  unit  case  volume  is one of  the  measures  of the
underlying  strength of the Coca-Cola business system because it measures trends
at the consumer level.

     In 2002,  concentrates  and  syrups for  beverages  bearing  the  trademark
"Coca-Cola" or including the trademark "Coke" accounted for approximately 57% of
the Company's total gallon sales.

     In  2002,  gallon  sales  in  the  United  States  ("U.S.   gallon  sales")
represented   approximately  28%  of  the  Company's   worldwide  gallon  sales.
Approximately  59% of U.S.  gallon sales for 2002 was  attributable  to sales of
beverage   concentrates  and  syrups  to  approximately  81  authorized  bottler
ownership  groups in  approximately  394 licensed  territories.  Those  bottlers
prepare and sell finished  beverages  bearing our  trademarks for the food store
and vending machine  distribution  channels and for other distribution  channels
supplying home and immediate consumption.  Approximately 33% of 2002 U.S. gallon
sales was  attributable  to fountain  syrups sold to fountain  retailers  and to
approximately 650 authorized fountain  wholesalers,  some of whom are authorized
bottlers.  These fountain wholesalers in turn sell the syrups or deliver them on
the Company's behalf to restaurants and other fountain retailers.  The remaining
approximately  8% of 2002 U.S.  gallon  sales was  attributable  to sales by the
Company of finished  beverages,  including  juice and  juice-drink  products and
certain  water  products.  Coca-Cola  Enterprises  Inc.,  including its bottling
subsidiaries   and   divisions   ("Coca-Cola   Enterprises"),    accounted   for
approximately  53% of the Company's  U.S.  gallon sales in 2002. At December 31,
2002, our Company held an ownership  interest of approximately  38% in Coca-Cola
Enterprises,   which  is  the  world's  largest  bottler  of  Company  Trademark
Beverages.

     In 2002, gallon sales outside the United States  represented  approximately
72% of the Company's  worldwide  gallon sales.  In 2002,  our principal  markets
outside the United States, based on gallon sales, were Mexico, Brazil, Japan and
Germany,  which together accounted for approximately 25% of our worldwide gallon
sales.  Approximately 90% of non-U.S. unit case volume for 2002 was attributable
to  sales  of  beverage  concentrates  and  syrups  to  authorized  bottlers  in
approximately  509 licensed  territories,  together with sales by the Company of
finished beverages other than juice and juice-drink  products.  Approximately 6%
of 2002  non-U.S.  unit case volume was  attributable  to fountain  syrups.  The
remaining approximately 4% of 2002 non-U.S. unit case volume was attributable to
juice and juice-drink products.

     In addition to conducting  its own  independent  advertising  and marketing
activities,  our Company may provide  promotional and marketing  services and/or
funds and consultation to its bottlers and to fountain and bottle/can retailers.
In most cases we do this on a discretionary basis, under the terms of commitment
letters or agreements, even though we are not obligated to do so under the terms
of the bottling or distribution agreements between our Company and the bottlers.
Also on a  discretionary  basis,  in most  cases,  the  Company  may develop and
introduce new products,  packages and equipment to assist its bottlers, fountain
syrup wholesalers and fountain beverage retailers. The aggregate amount of funds
provided by our Company to  bottlers,  resellers,  vendors or  customers  of our
Company's  products,  principally  including  participation  in sales  promotion
programs and volume-based incentives, was approximately $3.4 billion in 2002.

     The  profitability  of our business outside the United States is subject to
many factors,  including  governmental laws,  regulations and monetary policies,
economic  and  political  conditions  in the  countries in which our business is
conducted, and the risk of changes in currency exchange rates and regulations.

     Bottler's Agreements and Distribution Agreements
     ------------------------------------------------

     Separate contracts  ("Bottler's  Agreements") exist between our Company and
each of its bottlers regarding the manufacture and sale of soft drinks.  Subject
to  specified  terms  and  conditions  and  certain  variations,  the  Bottler's
Agreements  generally  authorize  the bottler to prepare  particular  designated
Company  Trademark  Beverages,  to  package  the same in  particular  authorized
containers,  and to distribute  and sell the same in (but  generally only in) an
identified   territory.   The  bottler  is  obligated  to  purchase  its  entire
requirement  of  concentrates  or syrups for the  designated  Company  Trademark
Beverages from the Company or Company-authorized  suppliers.  We typically agree
to refrain from selling or  distributing  or from  authorizing  third parties to
sell or distribute the designated  Company  Trademark  Beverages  throughout the
identified  territory  in the  particular  authorized  containers;  however,  we
typically  reserve for  ourselves  or our  designee the right (i) to prepare and
package such beverages in such  containers in the territory for sale outside the
territory and (ii) to prepare,  package,  distribute  and sell such beverages in
the territory in any other manner or form.

     The  Bottler's  Agreements  between us and our  authorized  bottlers in the
United  States differ in certain  respects from those in the other  countries in
which Company  Trademark  Beverages are sold. As further  discussed  below,  the
principal  differences involve the duration of the agreements;  the inclusion or
exclusion of canned beverage  production  rights;  the inclusion or exclusion of
authorizations to manufacture and distribute fountain syrups; in some cases, the
degree of  flexibility  on the part of the Company to  determine  the pricing of
syrups and concentrates;  and the extent, if any, of the Company's obligation to
provide marketing support.

     Outside the United  States.  The  Bottler's  Agreements  between us and our
authorized  bottlers outside the United States generally are of stated duration,
subject in some cases to  possible  extensions  or  renewals  of the term of the
contract.  Generally,  these contracts are subject to termination by the Company
following the occurrence of certain designated events,  including defined events
of default and certain changes in ownership or control of the bottler.

     In  certain  parts of the world  outside  the  United  States,  we have not
granted  comprehensive  beverage  production  rights  to the  bottlers.  In such
instances,  we or our designee typically sells canned (or in some cases bottled)
Company Trademark Beverages to the bottlers for sale and distribution throughout
the designated territory under distribution agreements, often on a non-exclusive
basis.  A majority of the Bottler's  Agreements in force between us and bottlers
outside the United States  authorize the bottler to  manufacture  and distribute
fountain syrups, usually on a non-exclusive basis.

     Our Company  generally has complete  flexibility to determine the price and
other terms of sale of concentrates  and syrups we sell to bottlers  outside the
United States. In some instances, we have agreed or may in the future agree with
the bottler  with  respect to  concentrate  pricing on a  prospective  basis for
specified  time  periods.  Outside the United  States,  in most cases we have no
obligation to provide marketing support to the bottlers.  Nevertheless,  we may,
in our discretion,  contribute towards bottler  expenditures for advertising and
marketing. We may also elect to undertake independent or cooperative advertising
and marketing activities.

     Within the United States.  In the United States,  with certain very limited
exceptions,  the Bottler's  Agreements  for  Coca-Cola  and other  cola-flavored
beverages have no stated expiration date. Our standard  contracts for other soft
drink flavors and for noncarbonated beverages are of stated duration, subject to
bottler  renewal  rights.  The  Bottler's  Agreements  in the United  States are
subject to termination by the Company for  nonperformance or upon the occurrence
of certain  defined  events of default which may vary from contract to contract.
The so-called  "1987  Contract,"  described  below, is terminable by the Company
upon the occurrence of certain events including:

     - the bottler's insolvency, dissolution, receivership or the like;
     - any  disposition by the bottler or any of its  subsidiaries of any voting
       securities of any bottler subsidiary without the consent of the Company;
     - any  material  breach of any  obligation  of the  bottler  under the 1987
       Contract; or
     - except in the case of certain  bottlers,  if a person or affiliated group
       acquires or obtains  any right to acquire  beneficial  ownership  of more
       than 10% of any  class or  series of  voting  securities  of the  bottler
       without authorization by the Company.

                                       5
<PAGE>

     Under the terms of the Bottler's Agreements,  bottlers in the United States
are authorized to  manufacture  and distribute  Company  Trademark  Beverages in
bottles and cans.  However,  these  bottlers  generally  are not  authorized  to
manufacture fountain syrups. Rather, our Company manufactures and sells fountain
syrups to approximately 650 authorized fountain  wholesalers  (including certain
authorized  bottlers) and some fountain retailers.  The wholesalers in turn sell
the syrups or deliver them on our behalf to restaurants and other retailers. The
wholesaler  typically  acts pursuant to a  non-exclusive  letter of  appointment
which neither  restricts the pricing of fountain  syrups by us nor the territory
in which the wholesaler may resell in the United States.

     In the United  States,  the form of Bottler's  Agreement for  cola-flavored
soft drinks that covers the largest amount of U.S. volume (the "1987  Contract")
gives us complete  flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of
soft drink concentrates and syrups for cola-flavored Company Trademark Beverages
("Coca-Cola Trademark Beverages") and other Company Trademark Beverages. In some
instances,  we have  agreed or may in the  future  agree with the  bottler  with
respect  to  concentrate  pricing  on a  prospective  basis for  specified  time
periods.  Bottlers operating under the 1987 Contract accounted for approximately
88% of our  Company's  total United  States  gallon sales for bottled and canned
beverages,  excluding  direct  sales by the  Company  of juice  and  juice-drink
products and other finished beverages ("U.S.  bottle/can gallon sales") in 2002.
Certain other forms of U.S.  Bottler's  Agreements,  entered into prior to 1987,
provide for soft drink  concentrates or syrups for certain  Coca-Cola  Trademark
Beverages  to be priced  pursuant to a stated  formula.  The oldest such form of
contract,  applicable  to  bottlers  accounting  for  approximately  1% of  U.S.
bottle/can gallon sales in 2002,  provides for a fixed price for Coca-Cola syrup
used in bottles  and cans.  This price is subject to  quarterly  adjustments  to
reflect  changes  in the  quoted  price of sugar.  Bottlers  accounting  for the
remaining  approximately  11% of U.S.  bottle/can  gallon  sales  in  2002  have
contracts  for certain  Coca-Cola  Trademark  Beverages  with  pricing  formulas
generally  providing for a baseline  price.  This baseline price may be adjusted
periodically  by the Company,  up to a maximum  indexed  ceiling  price,  and is
adjusted  quarterly based upon changes in certain sugar or sweetener  prices, as
applicable.

     We have standard  contracts with bottlers in the United States for the sale
of  concentrates  and  syrups for  non-cola-flavored  soft  drinks  and  certain
noncarbonated  beverages in bottles and cans;  and in certain cases for the sale
of finished  noncarbonated  beverages in bottles and cans. All of these standard
contracts give the Company complete flexibility to determine the price and other
terms of sale.

     Under the 1987  Contract  and most of our  other  standard  soft  drink and
noncarbonated beverage contracts with bottlers in the United States, our Company
has no obligation to participate  with bottlers in expenditures  for advertising
and marketing.  Nevertheless,  in our  discretion we may contribute  toward such
expenditures and undertake independent or cooperative  advertising and marketing
activities.  Some U.S.  Bottler's  Agreements  that  pre-date the 1987  Contract
impose  certain  marketing  obligations  on us with  respect to certain  Company
Trademark Beverages.

     The Company's ability to exercise its contractual  flexibility to determine
the price and other  terms of sale of its  syrups,  concentrates,  and  finished
beverages under various  agreements  described above is, both outside and within
the United States, subject to competitive market conditions.

     Significant Equity Investments and Company Bottling Operations
     --------------------------------------------------------------

     Our Company maintains business  relationships with three types of bottlers:
(1)  independently  owned  bottlers,  in  which  the  Company  has no  ownership
interest;   (2)   bottlers  in  which  the  Company  has   invested  and  has  a
noncontrolling  ownership  interest;  and (3)  bottlers in which the Company has
invested and has a controlling ownership interest. In 2002,  independently owned
bottling operations produced and distributed  approximately 23% of our worldwide
unit case  volume.  We have  equity  positions  in 53  unconsolidated  bottling,
canning and distribution  operations for our products  worldwide.  These cost or
equity  method  investees  produced  and  distributed  approximately  59% of our
worldwide  unit  case  volume  in 2002.  Controlled  and  consolidated  bottling
operations produced and distributed  approximately 8% of our worldwide unit case
volume in 2002.  Fountain  operations  and The  Minute  Maid  Company  (a global
division with operations primarily in the United States and Canada) produced and
distributed the remaining approximately 10% of our worldwide unit case volume in
2002.

     We make  equity  investments  in  selected  bottling  operations  with  the
intention of maximizing  the strength and  efficiency of the Coca-Cola  system's
production,   distribution  and  marketing  systems  around  the  world.   These

                                       6
<PAGE>

investments  are  intended  to result in  increases  in unit  case  volume,  net
revenues,  and profits at the bottler  level,  which in turn generate  increased
gallon sales for our Company's concentrate  business.  When this occurs, both we
and the bottlers  benefit from long-term  growth in volume,  improved cash flows
and increased share-owner value.

     The level of our  investment  generally  depends on the  bottler's  capital
structure  and  its  available   resources  at  the  time  of  the   investment.
Historically,  in  certain  situations,  we have  viewed it as  advantageous  to
acquire a  controlling  interest in a bottling  operation,  often on a temporary
basis.  Owning such a  controlling  interest  has allowed us to  compensate  for
limited local resources and has enabled us to help focus the bottler's sales and
marketing  programs and assist in the development of the bottler's  business and
information systems and the establishment of appropriate capital structures.

     In line with our long-term bottling strategy,  we may periodically consider
options for reducing our ownership interest in a bottler.  One such option is to
combine our bottling  interests  with the  bottling  interests of others to form
strategic  business  alliances.  Another  option  is to sell our  interest  in a
bottling  operation  to one of our equity  investee  bottlers.  In both of these
situations,  our Company  continues to participate  in the bottler's  results of
operations through its share of the equity investee's earnings or losses.

     In  cases  where  our  investments  in  bottlers  represent  noncontrolling
interests,  our  intention is to provide  expertise  and resources to strengthen
those businesses.

     Significant  investees that we account for by the equity method include the
following:

     Coca-Cola  Enterprises Inc. Our ownership interest in Coca-Cola Enterprises
was approximately 38% at December 31, 2002. Coca-Cola Enterprises is the world's
largest  bottler  of the  Company's  beverage  products.  In 2002,  net sales of
concentrates   and  syrups  by  the  Company  to  Coca-Cola   Enterprises   were
approximately $4.3 billion.  Coca-Cola Enterprises also purchases  high-fructose
corn syrup through the Company;  however,  related  collections  from  Coca-Cola
Enterprises  and  payments  to  suppliers  are  not  included  in the  Company's
consolidated  statements of income.  Coca-Cola  Enterprises  estimates  that the
territories in which it markets  beverage  products to retailers  (which include
portions of 46 states and the  District of Columbia in the U.S.,  Canada,  Great
Britain,  continental France, the Netherlands,  Luxembourg,  Belgium and Monaco)
contain approximately 79% of the United States population, 98% of the population
of Canada, and 100% of the populations of Great Britain, continental France, the
Netherlands, Luxembourg, Belgium and Monaco.

     Excluding products in post-mix (fountain) form, in 2002,  approximately 62%
of the unit  case  volume  of  Coca-Cola  Enterprises  was  Coca-Cola  Trademark
Beverages, approximately 31% of its unit case volume was other Company Trademark
Beverages, and approximately 7% of its unit case volume was beverage products of
other   companies.   Coca-Cola   Enterprises'   net   operating   revenues  were
approximately $16.9 billion in 2002.

     Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company S.A. ("Coca-Cola HBC"). At December 31,
2002, our ownership  interest in Coca-Cola HBC was approximately  24%. Coca-Cola
HBC has bottling and  distribution  rights,  through  direct  ownership or joint
ventures,  in  Armenia,  Austria,  Belarus,  Bosnia,  Bulgaria,  Croatia,  Czech
Republic,  Estonia,  Greece,  Hungary,  Latvia,  Lithuania,   Northern  Ireland,
Republic  of Ireland,  Italy,  Macedonia,  Moldova,  Nigeria,  Poland,  Romania,
Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland,  Ukraine and Yugoslavia.  Coca-Cola HBC
estimates that the  territories in which it markets  beverage  products  contain
approximately  67% of the population of Italy and 100% of the populations of the
other countries named above in which Coca-Cola HBC has bottling and distribution
rights.

     In 2002,  Coca-Cola HBC's net sales of beverage products were approximately
U.S.$3.6  billion.  In  2002,  approximately  53% of the  unit  case  volume  of
Coca-Cola HBC was Coca-Cola Trademark  Beverages,  approximately 41% of its unit
case volume was other Company  Trademark  Beverages and  approximately 6% of its
unit case volume was beverage products of Coca-Cola HBC or other companies.

     Coca-Cola Amatil Limited  ("Coca-Cola  Amatil").  At December 31, 2002, our
Company's   ownership  interest  in  Coca-Cola  Amatil  was  approximately  35%.
Coca-Cola  Amatil is the largest bottler of the Company's  beverage  products in
Australia  and  also  has  bottling  and  distribution  rights,  through  direct
ownership or joint ventures, in New Zealand,  Fiji, Papua New Guinea,  Indonesia
and South Korea.  Coca-Cola  Amatil  estimates that the  territories in which it
markets  beverage  products  contain  approximately  99%  of the  population  of
Australia,  100% of the

                                       7
<PAGE>

populations of New Zealand, Fiji and South Korea, 93% of the population of Papua
New Guinea and 98% of the population of Indonesia.

     In  2002,   Coca-Cola   Amatil's  net  sales  of  beverage   products  were
approximately  U.S.$1.9  billion.  In 2002,  approximately  58% of the unit case
volume of Coca-Cola Amatil was Coca-Cola Trademark Beverages,  approximately 34%
of its unit case volume was other Company Trademark Beverages,  approximately 7%
of  its  unit  case  volume  was  beverage  products  of  Coca-Cola  Amatil  and
approximately  1% of its  unit  case  volume  was  beverage  products  of  other
companies.

     Panamerican Beverages, Inc. ("Panamco").  At December 31, 2002, our Company
owned an equity interest of approximately 25% in Panamco,  a Panamanian  holding
company with bottling  subsidiaries  operating in a substantial  part of central
Mexico (excluding  Mexico City);  greater Sao Paulo, Campinas,  Santos and Matto
Grosso do Sul, Brazil;  central  Guatemala;  most of Colombia;  and all of Costa
Rica, Venezuela, Nicaragua and Panama. Panamco estimates that the territories in
which it markets beverage  products contain  approximately 18% of the population
of Mexico,  14% of the population of Brazil,  95% of the population of Colombia,
38% of the  population of Guatemala and 100% of the  populations  of Costa Rica,
Venezuela, Nicaragua and Panama.

     In 2002,  Panamco's  net  sales of  beverage  products  were  approximately
U.S.$2.4 billion. In 2002,  approximately 52% of the unit case volume of Panamco
was Coca-Cola Trademark Beverages, approximately 26% of its unit case volume was
other Company Trademark  Beverages and approximately 22% of its unit case volume
was beverage products of Panamco or other companies.

     Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A. de C.V.  ("Coca-Cola  FEMSA").  At December 31, 2002,
our Company owned a 30% equity  interest in Coca-Cola  FEMSA, a Mexican  holding
company  with  bottling   subsidiaries   in  the  Valley  of  Mexico,   Mexico's
southeastern  region  and  greater  Buenos  Aires,  Argentina.  Coca-Cola  FEMSA
estimates that the  territories in which it markets  beverage  products  contain
approximately  30% of the  population  of Mexico  and  approximately  31% of the
population of Argentina.

     In  2002,   Coca-Cola   FEMSA's  net  sales  of  beverage   products   were
approximately  U.S.$1.7  billion.  In 2002,  approximately  71% of the unit case
volume of Coca-Cola FEMSA was Coca-Cola Trademark  Beverages,  approximately 27%
of its unit case volume was other Company Trademark  Beverages and approximately
2% of its unit case volume was  beverage  products of  Coca-Cola  FEMSA or other
companies.

     In December  2002,  it was  announced  that  Coca-Cola  FEMSA has reached a
definitive  agreement  to acquire  Panamco in a merger  transaction  expected to
close in the first half of 2003.  Completion of this  transaction  is subject to
approval by Panamco's  share  owners,  regulatory  approvals  and other  closing
conditions. Immediately following completion of the merger, our Company would no
longer  directly own an equity  interest in Panamco,  and our  Company's  equity
interest in Coca-Cola FEMSA would increase from 30% to approximately 40%.

     Other Interests.  We own a 50% interest in a joint venture with Nestle S.A.
("Nestle")  and  certain  of  its   subsidiaries   which  is  focused  upon  the
ready-to-drink tea and coffee businesses.  The joint venture,  known as Beverage
Partners  Worldwide  ("BPW"),  currently  has  sales in the  United  States  and
approximately  45 other countries.  BPW serves as the exclusive  vehicle through
which our Company and Nestle participate  in the  ready-to-drink  tea and coffee
business,  except in Japan.  BPW markets  ready-to-drink  tea products under the
Nestea, Belte, Yang Guang, Nagomi and Tey trademarks, and ready-to-drink  coffee
products under the Nescafe, Taster's Choice and Georgia Club trademarks. It also
operates the Mad River noncarbonated beverage business in the United States.

Other Developments
- ------------------

     In November  2001,  we entered into a Control and Profit and Loss  Transfer
Agreement ("CPL Agreement") with Coca-Cola  Erfrischungsgetraenke  AG ("CCEAG"),
the  largest  bottler  in  Germany.  Under the terms of the CPL  Agreement,  our
Company acquired  management control of CCEAG. In November 2001, we also entered
into a Pooling  Agreement  ("Pooling  Agreement")  with certain  share owners of
CCEAG that provided our Company with voting  control of CCEAG.  Both  agreements
became  effective as of February  2002 for a term ending no later than  December
31,  2006.  In return for  control of CCEAG,  pursuant to the CPL  Agreement  we
guaranteed  annual  payments,  in lieu of dividends by CCEAG, to all other CCEAG
share owners.  Additionally,  all other CCEAG share

                                       8
<PAGE>


owners  entered  into  either  a put or a  put/call  option  agreement  with the
Company,  exercisable  at the end of the  term of the CPL  Agreement  at  agreed
prices.  At December 31, 2002,  our  Company's  ownership  interest in CCEAG was
approximately 41%. This transaction was accounted for as a business combination,
and the  results of  CCEAG's  operations  have been  included  in our  Company's
consolidated financial statements since February 2002.

     In February 2003, CCEAG announced plans to streamline its operations and to
improve  efficiency  in sales and  distribution.  Three  plants  operated by the
bottler will be closed but will continue to operate as distribution  centers.  A
new bottling plant for  noncarbonated  beverages  will soon start  operations in
Halle.  Implementation  of the plan will  result  in a  headcount  reduction  of
approximately 900 employees.

     In January  2002,  our Company and  Coca-Cola  Bottlers  Philippines,  Inc.
("CCBPI")  acquired  from RFM Corp.,  a  Philippine  food and  beverage  concern
("RFM"),   RFM's   approximately  83%  ownership  interest  in  Cosmos  Bottling
Corporation ("Cosmos"),  a publicly traded Philippine beverage company. In March
2002,  a tender offer was  completed  with our Company and CCBPI  acquiring  all
shares of the remaining  minority share owners except for shares  representing a
one percent  ownership  interest in Cosmos.  At December  31,  2002,  our direct
ownership  interest in Cosmos was approximately  61%, and our indirect ownership
interest in Cosmos was approximately  13%. This transaction was accounted for as
a business combination, and the results of Cosmos' operations have been included
in our Company's  consolidated  financial  statements  since  January 2002.  The
Company and CCBPI have agreed to restructure the operations of Cosmos,  and this
restructuring  will result in our Company  owning all  acquired  trademarks  and
CCBPI owning all acquired bottling assets.  This restructuring is expected to be
completed in 2003.

     In April 2002,  our Company  entered into a master  distribution  agreement
with Groupe Danone  ("Danone") and certain  subsidiaries  of Danone  pursuant to
which our  Company was  appointed  the  exclusive  master  distributor  of Evian
bottled water in the United States and Canada effective July 1, 2002. Under this
master  agreement,  our Company is responsible  for managing  market  execution,
sales and distribution for Evian in the United States and Canada,  including the
development  of  marketing  plans,  media  planning  and  consumer  and customer
promotions.  Danone and its  subsidiaries are responsible for all global product
development and brand strategy efforts for Evian, as well as providing sales and
customer service support.  The stated term of the master agreement is perpetual,
subject to earlier termination in the event of default.  Under this arrangement,
Evian bottled water  continues to be distributed by Coca-Cola  Enterprises  Inc.
and other licensed  Coca-Cola  bottlers  within the U.S. and Canada,  as well as
certain other existing distributors of Evian.

     In July 2002, our Company and Danone Waters of North America, Inc. ("DWNA")
formed  a new  company,  CCDA  Waters,  L.L.C.  ("CCDA"),  for  the  production,
marketing and distribution of DWNA's bottled spring and source water business in
the  United  States.  In forming  CCDA,  DWNA  contributed  assets of its retail
bottled  spring and source  water  business in the United  States.  These assets
include  five  production  facilities,  a license  for the use of the Dannon and
Sparkletts  brands,  and ownership of several  value brands.  Our Company made a
cash payment to acquire a  controlling  51% equity  interest in CCDA and is also
providing marketing, distribution and management expertise. This transaction was
accounted for as a business  combination,  and the results of CCDA's  operations
have been included in our Company's consolidated financial statements since July
2002. This business  combination expanded our water brands to include a national
offering in all sectors of the water category with  purified,  spring and source
waters.

     In January 2003, we announced that we are integrating the operations of our
three  separate  business  units  in  North  America:  Coca-Cola  North  America
(including our interest in CCDA), The Minute Maid Company (including our Odwalla
business) and Coca-Cola  Fountain.  Going forward,  the integrated business unit
will be referred to simply as Coca-Cola  North  America.  The  integration  plan
calls for the unification of information  technology,  human  resources,  sales,
marketing,  finance,  legal and administrative  staffs to eliminate  unnecessary
duplication  of effort.  The  integration  is  expected to result in a headcount
reduction  of  approximately   1,000  people,  and  the  identification  of  the
individuals  is  expected  to be  completed  during  the first  quarter of 2003.

Seasonality
- -----------

     Sales of ready-to-drink  nonalcoholic beverages are somewhat seasonal, with
the second and third calendar quarters  accounting for the highest sales volumes
in the Northern Hemisphere. The volume of sales in the beverages business may be
affected by weather conditions.

Competition
- -----------

     Our  Company  competes  in  the  nonalcoholic   beverages  segment  of  the
commercial beverages industry.  Based on internally available data and a variety
of  industry  sources,  we  believe  that in 2002,  worldwide  sales of  Company
products  comprised  approximately  10% of total worldwide sales of nonalcoholic
beverage  products.   The  nonalcoholic  beverages  segment  of  the  commercial
beverages  industry is highly  competitive,  consisting of numerous firms. These
include firms that compete,  like our Company, in multiple geographical areas as
well as  firms  that are  primarily  local in  operation.  Competitive  products
include  carbonates,  packaged  water,  juices  and  nectars,  fruit  drinks and
dilutables  (including  syrups and powdered  drinks),  sports and energy drinks,
coffee and tea,  still drinks and other  beverages.  Nonalcoholic  beverages are
sold to consumers in both ready-to-drink and not-ready-to-drink form. In many of
the  countries in which we do business,  including the United  States,  PepsiCo,
Inc. is a primary  competitor of ours.  Other  significant  competitors  include
Nestle S.A.,  Cadbury  Schweppes plc, Groupe Danone and Kraft Foods Inc.,  among
others.

     Most of our beverages business currently is in soft drinks, as that term is
defined  in  this  report.  The  soft-drink  business,  which  is  part  of  the
nonalcoholic beverages segment, is itself highly competitive. Our Company is the
leading  seller of  soft-drink  concentrates  and syrups in the world.  Numerous
firms,  however,  compete in that  business.  These consist of a range of firms,
from local to  international,  that  compete  against  our  Company in  numerous
geographical areas.

     Competitive   factors  with  respect  to  our  business   include  pricing,
advertising  and  sales  promotion  programs,   product  innovation,   increased
efficiency in production  techniques,  the  introduction  of new packaging,  new
vending  and  dispensing  equipment  and brand  and  trademark  development  and
protection.

     Positive  aspects of our competitive  position include strong brands with a
high  level  of  consumer  acceptance,  a  worldwide  network  of  bottlers  and
distributors of Company  products,  sophisticated  marketing  capabilities and a
talented  group of  dedicated  employees.  Negative  aspects of our  competitive
position  include  strong  competition in nearly all  geographies,  and, in many
countries,  a  concentrated  retail sector with  powerful  buyers able to freely
choose between Company products and those of its competitors.

Raw Materials
- -------------

     The  principal  raw material  used by our business in the United  States is
high-fructose  corn syrup,  a form of sugar,  which is available  from  numerous
domestic  sources  and is  historically  subject to  fluctuations  in its market
price. The principal raw material used by our business outside the United States
is sucrose.  Our Company has a specialized  sweetener  procurement staff and has
not experienced any  difficulties in obtaining its  requirements.  In the United
States and certain other countries,  we have authorized the use of high-fructose
corn syrup for Coca-Cola and other Company  Trademark  Beverages for use in both
fountain syrup and finished beverages in bottles and cans.

     Generally,  raw  materials  utilized  by us in  our  business  are  readily
available from numerous sources. However, aspartame, which is usually used alone
or  in  combination  with  either  saccharin  or  acesulfame  potassium  in  our
low-calorie soft-drink products, is currently purchased by us primarily from The
NutraSweet Company and from Holland Sweetener. Acesulfame potassium is currently
purchased from Nutrinova Nutrition Specialties & Food Ingredients GmbH.

     With  regard to juice and  juice-drink  products,  the citrus  industry  is
subject to the  variability of weather  conditions.  This includes in particular
the possibility of freezes in central Florida, which may result in higher prices
and lower consumer demand for orange juice  throughout the industry.  Due to our
long-standing  relationship  with a supplier of  high-quality  Brazilian  orange
juice  concentrate,  the  supply of juice  available  that  meets the  Company's
standards is normally adequate to meet demand.

Patents, Trade Secrets, Trademarks and Copyrights
- -------------------------------------------------

     Our Company is the owner of numerous patents, copyrights and trade secrets,
as well as substantial  know-how and technology,  which we collectively refer to
in this  report  as  "technology."  This  technology  generally  relates  to our
Company's products and the processes for their production, the packages used for
its products,  the design and operation of various  processes and equipment used
in its business and certain quality  assurance and financial  software.  Some of
the  technology is licensed to suppliers and other  parties.  Our soft-drink and
other beverage formulae are among the important trade secrets of the Company.

     We own  numerous  trademarks  which  are very  important  to our  business.
Depending upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are in use
and/or their  registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found
to have become  generic.  Registrations  of trademarks  can generally be renewed
indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use. The majority of our Company's
trademark license agreements are included in the Company's Bottler's Agreements.
The Company has  registered  and  licenses  the right to use its  trademarks  in
conjunction with certain merchandise in addition to nonalcoholic beverages.

Governmental Regulation
- -----------------------

     Our  Company is required  to comply,  and it is our policy to comply,  with
applicable  laws in the numerous  countries  throughout the world in which we do
business. In many jurisdictions,  compliance with competition laws is of special
importance  to us,  and our  operations  may  come  under  special  scrutiny  by
competition  law  authorities,   due  to  our  competitive   position  in  those
jurisdictions.

     The production,  distribution  and sale in the United States of many of the
Company's  products are subject to the Federal Food,  Drug and Cosmetic Act; the
Occupational  Safety  and Health  Act;  the Lanham  Act;  various  environmental
statutes;  and various other federal,  state and local statutes and  regulations
applicable  to  the  production,   transportation,  sale,  safety,  advertising,
labeling and ingredients of such products.

     A California  law requires  that a specific  warning  appear on any product
that  contains  a  component  listed by the State as having  been found to cause
cancer or birth defects.  The law exposes all food and beverage producers to the
possibility of having to provide warnings on their products. This is because the
law recognizes no generally  applicable  quantitative  thresholds  below which a
warning is not required.  Consequently,  even trace amounts of listed components
can  expose  affected  products  to the  prospect  of warning  labels.  Products
containing  listed  substances  that occur  naturally in the product or that are
contributed  to the product  solely by a municipal  water  supply are  generally
exempt from the warning requirement.  No Company beverage products are currently
required to display warnings under this law.  However,  we are unable to predict
whether  an  important  component  of a  Company  product  might be added to the
California list in the future.  We are also unable to predict whether or to what
extent a  warning  under  this law  would  have an  impact  on costs or sales of
Company beverage products.

     Bottlers  of  our  beverage   products   presently  offer   non-refillable,
recyclable  containers  in all areas of the United  States and  Canada.  Some of
these  bottlers also offer  refillable  containers,  which are also  recyclable.
Measures have been enacted in various localities and states which require that a
deposit be charged for certain non-refillable  beverage containers.  The precise
requirements imposed by these measures vary. Other deposit, recycling or product
stewardship  proposals  have  been  introduced  in  various  jurisdictions.   We
anticipate that similar legislation or regulations may be proposed in the future
at the local, state and federal levels, both in the United States and elsewhere.


     All of our  Company's  facilities  in the  United  States  are  subject  to
federal,  state and local  environmental  laws and regulations.  Compliance with
these  provisions has not had, and we do not expect such compliance to have, any
material adverse effect upon our Company's capital  expenditures,  net income or
competitive position.

Employees
- ---------

     As of December 31, 2002, our Company employed approximately 56,000 persons,
compared to approximately  38,000 at the end of 2001. The increase in the number
of employees was primarily due to acquisitions  made during 2002,  including the
acquisitions  of our  interests in Cosmos and CCDA,  plus the  consolidation  of
CCEAG. At the end of 2002,  approximately  10,900 Company employees were located
in the United States.

     Our  Company,  through its  divisions  and  subsidiaries,  has entered into
numerous collective bargaining agreements.  We have no reason to believe that we
will not be able to renegotiate any such agreements on satisfactory  terms.  The
Company   believes  that  its   relations   with  its  employees  are  generally
satisfactory.

Securities Exchange Act Reports
- -------------------------------

     The  Company  maintains  an  Internet  website  at the  following  address:
www.coca-cola.com.  We make available on or through our Internet website certain
reports and  amendments  to those reports that we file with the  Securities  and
Exchange  Commission (the "SEC") in accordance with the Securities  Exchange Act
of 1934 (the  "Securities  Exchange  Act").  These include our annual reports on
Form 10-K,  our quarterly  reports on Form 10-Q and our current  reports on Form
8-K. We make this information available on our website free of charge as soon as
reasonably  practicable  after we  electronically  file the information with, or
furnish it to, the SEC.


ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
- ------------------

     Our  worldwide  headquarters  is  located  on a 35-acre  office  complex in
Atlanta,  Georgia.  The complex includes the  approximately  621,000 square foot
headquarters  building,  the  approximately  870,000 square foot Coca-Cola North
America  building and the  approximately  264,000  square foot  Coca-Cola  Plaza
building.  The complex also  includes  several  other  buildings,  including the
technical and engineering facilities,  learning center and reception center. Our
Company leases approximately  250,000 square feet of office space at 10 Glenlake
Parkway,  Atlanta,  Georgia. In addition,  we lease approximately 174,000 square
feet of office space at Northridge Business Park,  Dunwoody,  Georgia. The North
America  operating  segment  owns and  occupies  an office  building  located in
Houston, Texas, that contains approximately 330,000 square feet. The Company has
facilities for administrative operations, manufacturing,  processing, packaging,
packing, storage and warehousing throughout the United States.

     As of December  31,  2002,  our  Company  owned and  operated 33  principal
beverage  concentrate and/or syrup  manufacturing  plants located throughout the
world. In addition, we own or hold a majority interest in 39 operations with 103
principal  beverage  bottling  and  canning  plants  located  outside the United
States. CCDA owns four production facilities and leases one production facility.
All five of these facilities are located in the United States.

     The North America segment  operates eight juice and juice drink  production
facilities  located  throughout  the United States and Canada.  The Company also
owns a facility that  manufactures  juice  concentrates for food service use. It
also  utilizes a system of contract  packers to produce and  distribute  certain
products in areas where the Company does not have its own manufacturing  centers
or during periods when it experiences shortfalls in manufacturing capacity.

     Our  Company  owns  or  leases   additional   real   estate,   including  a
Company-owned  office and retail  building at 711 Fifth Avenue in New York,  New
York and approximately 315,000 square feet of Company-owned office and technical
space in  Brussels,  Belgium.  Additional  owned or leased real  estate  located
throughout  the world is used by the  Company  as office  space,  for  bottling,
warehouse or retail operations or, in the case of some owned property, is leased
to others.

     Management believes that the Company's facilities for the production of its
products are suitable and adequate,  that they are being appropriately  utilized
in line with past experience and that they have sufficient  production  capacity
for  their  present  intended  purposes.  The  extent  of  utilization  of  such
facilities varies based upon the seasonal demand for product. It is not possible
to measure with any degree of certainty or uniformity  the  productive  capacity
and extent of utilization of these facilities. However, management believes that
additional production can be obtained at the existing facilities by the addition
of personnel  and capital  equipment  and, in some  facilities,  the addition of
shifts of personnel or expansion of such facilities.  We continuously review our
anticipated  requirements

                                       12
<PAGE>

for facilities  and, on the basis of that review,  may from time to time acquire
additional facilities and/or dispose of existing facilities.


ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
- -------------------------

     On October 27, 2000, a class action lawsuit  (Carpenter's  Health & Welfare
Fund of Philadelphia & Vicinity v. The Coca-Cola  Company,  et al.) was filed in
the United States District Court for the Northern  District of Georgia  alleging
that the  Company,  M.  Douglas  Ivester,  Jack L.  Stahl and James E.  Chestnut
violated  antifraud   provisions  of  the  federal  securities  laws  by  making
misrepresentations  or material  omissions  relating to the Company's  financial
condition and prospects in late 1999 and early 2000. A second, largely identical
lawsuit (Gaetan LaValla v. The Coca-Cola Company,  et al.) was filed in the same
court on  November  9, 2000.  The  Complaints  allege  that the  Company and the
individual  named  officers:  (1) forced certain  Coca-Cola  system  bottlers to
accept "excessive,  unwanted and unneeded" sales of concentrate during the third
and fourth quarters of 1999, thus creating a misleading  sense of improvement in
our Company's performance in those quarters;  (2) failed to write down the value
of impaired  assets in Russia,  Japan and  elsewhere  on a timely  basis,  again
resulting in the  presentation of misleading  interim  financial  results in the
third and fourth  quarters of 1999; and (3)  misrepresented  the reasons for Mr.
Ivester's  departure  from the  Company  and  then  misleadingly  reassured  the
financial  community  that  there  would be no  changes  in the  Company's  core
business strategy or financial  outlook following that departure.  Damages in an
unspecified amount are sought in both Complaints.

     On January  8, 2001,  an order was  entered by the United  States  District
Court for the Northern  District of Georgia  consolidating the two cases for all
purposes.  The Court also ordered the plaintiffs to file a Consolidated  Amended
Complaint.  On July 25, 2001, plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Amended Complaint,
which largely repeated the allegations made in the original Complaints and added
Douglas N. Daft as an additional defendant.

     On September 25, 2001, the defendants  filed a Motion to Dismiss all counts
of the Consolidated Amended Complaint.  On August 20, 2002, the Court granted in
part and  denied in part the  defendants'  Motion  to  Dismiss.  The Court  also
granted the plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to Amend the Complaint. On September 4,
2002, the defendants filed a Motion for Partial  Reconsideration  of the Court's
August 20, 2002 ruling.  This latter Motion is currently under  consideration by
the Court.

     On December 20, 2002, the Company filed a lawsuit (The Coca-Cola Company v.
Aqua-Chem,  Inc., Civil Action No.  2002CV631-50) in the Superior Court,  Fulton
County, Georgia (the "Georgia  Case")  seeking a  declaratory  judgment that the
Company has no obligation to its former  subsidiary,  Aqua-Chem,  Inc.,  for any
past, present or future liabilities or expenses in connection with any claims or
lawsuits against Aqua-Chem.  Subsequent to the Company's filing, on the same day
Aqua-Chem  filed a lawsuit  (Aqua-Chem,  Inc. v. The  Coca-Cola  Company,  Civil
Action No. 02CV012179) in the Circuit Court, Civil Division of Milwaukee County,
Wisconsin (the  "Wisconsin  Case").  In the Wisconsin  Case,  Aqua-Chem  seeks a
declaratory  judgment that the Company is responsible  for all  liabilities  and
expenses in connection with certain of Aqua-Chem's general and product liability
claims  arising from  occurrences  prior to the  Company's  sale of Aqua-Chem in
1981,  and a judgment  for breach of contract in an amount  exceeding $9 million
for defense  costs,  expenses and  settlements  incurred by Aqua-Chem to date in
connection with such claims.

     The Company owned Aqua-Chem from 1970 to 1981.  During that time frame, the
Company  purchased over $400 million of insurance  coverage that is available to
cover Aqua-Chem for certain product liability and other claims.  Cleaver Brooks,
an Aqua-Chem subsidiary,  manufactured boilers, some of which contained asbestos
gaskets. The Company sold Aqua-Chem to Lyonnaise American Holding,  Inc. in 1981
under the terms of a stock sale agreement,  and, following a lawsuit involving a
tax  dispute,  entered into a settlement  agreement in 1983 with  Lyonnaise  and
Aqua-Chem.  The 1981 and 1983  agreements,  among  other  things,  outlined  the
parties' rights and  obligations  concerning past and future claims and lawsuits
involving Aqua-Chem.

     Aqua-Chem was first named as a defendant in asbestos  lawsuits in or around
1985 and, to date, has more than 100,000  claims pending  against it. In October
2002,  Aqua-Chem  asserted  that since 1985 it had  incurred  approximately  $10
million in expenses  related to these claims that were not covered by insurance.
Aqua-Chem  demanded that the Company  reimburse  these expenses  pursuant to its
interpretation  of the terms of the 1981 and 1983  agreements.  It also demanded
that the Company acknowledge its continuing obligations to Aqua-Chem under

                                       13
<PAGE>

these agreements for any future  liabilities and expenses that are excluded from
coverage under the applicable insurance or for which there is no insurance.  The
Company disputes  Aqua-Chem's  interpretation  of the agreements and believes it
has no past, present or future obligation to Aqua-Chem in this regard.  This led
to the filing of the Georgia Case.

     The parties have agreed to stay the Wisconsin Case pending final resolution
of the Georgia Case.  The parties have further  agreed to a six month  discovery
schedule in the Georgia Case.  On January 15, 2003,  the court entered a consent
order in the  Georgia  Case  setting  forth the agreed  discovery  schedule.  On
January 22, 2003, the Wisconsin  Court entered a consent order  submitted by the
parties staying the Wisconsin Case.

     The Company  believes  it has  substantial  legal and  factual  defenses to
Aqua-Chem's  claims and intends to  vigorously  prosecute  the Georgia  Case and
defend the Wisconsin Case.

     The  competition  authority of the  European  Commission  made  unannounced
visits to the offices of the Company  and of our  bottling  partners in Austria,
Belgium,  Denmark,  Germany and Great Britain several years ago. Similarly,  the
Spanish  competition  authorities made unannounced visits to our own offices and
those of certain  bottlers in Spain in September  2000. The European  Commission
and the Spanish  competition  authorities  continue  their  investigations  into
unspecified  market  practices in their  respective  jurisdictions.  The Company
believes it has substantial legal and factual defenses in these matters.

     The Company is involved in various other legal  proceedings.  Management of
the Company  believes  that any  liability  to the Company  which may arise as a
result of these proceedings,  including the proceedings  specifically  discussed
above, will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the
Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole.

accumulated and  communicated to the Company's  management,  including its Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,  as appropriate,  to allow timely
decisions  regarding  required  disclosure.  In  designing  and  evaluating  the
disclosure controls and procedures,  management recognized that any controls and
procedures,  no  matter  how  well  designed  and  operated,  can  provide  only
reasonable  assurance of achieving the desired control  objectives,  as ours are
designed to do, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in
evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

     During the 90-day  period prior to the date of this report,  an  evaluation
was performed under the supervision and with the  participation of our Company's
management,  including  the Chief  Executive  Officer  and the  Chief  Financial
Officer,  of the  effectiveness  of the design and  operation of our  disclosure
controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer
and the Chief  Financial  Officer  concluded  that our  disclosure  controls and
procedures were effective. Subsequent to the date of this evaluation, there have
been no  significant  changes in the  Company's  internal  controls  or in other
factors  that could  significantly  affect  these  controls,  and no  corrective
actions taken with regard to significant  deficiencies or material weaknesses in
such controls.

disclosed in solicitations of proxies for elections of directors, or is
otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the 1934 Act
(including, without limitation, such person's written consent to being named in
the proxy statement, if any, as a nominee and to serving as a director if
elected); and (ii) as to such shareholder giving notice, the information
required to be provided pursuant to Section 10. At the request of the Board of

     Section 1. Indemnification of Directors, and Officers, Employees and
Agents. The Company shall indemnify any person who was or is a party
or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Company) by reason
of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the
Company, or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys' fees),
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred
by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good
faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interest of the Company, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding,
had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of
any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or
upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a
presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the Company,
and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to
believe that his conduct was unlawful.

     The Company shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is
threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or
suit by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor by
reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of
the Company, or is or was serving at the request of the Company, as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually
and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of
such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company and except
that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter
as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Company
unless and only to the extent


Page 11 of 16

<PAGE>


that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was
brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of
liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is
fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of
Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.

     Section 2. Expenses. To the extent that a director, officer, employee or
agent of the Company has been successful on the merits or otherwise, in whole or
in part, in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in the first
two paragraphs of this Section 1 or in defense of any claim, issue or matter
therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees)
actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith. The entitlement
to expenses under this Section 2 shall include any expenses incurred by a
director, officer, employee or agent of the Company in connection with any
action, suit or proceeding brought by such director, officer, employee or agent
to enforce a right to indemnification or payment of expenses under this Article.
If successful in whole or in part in any such action, suit or proceeding, or in
any action, suit or proceeding brought by the Company to recover a payment of
expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking provided in accordance with
Section 4, the director, officer, employee or agent also shall be entitled
to be paid the expense of prosecuting or defending such action, suit or
proceeding.

     Section 3. Procedure for Receiving Indemnification. To receive
indemnification under this By-Law, a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Company shall submit to the Company a written request, including therein or
therewith such documentation and information as is reasonably available to him
and reasonably necessary to determine his entitlement to indemnification. Upon
receipt by the Company of a written request for indemnification, a
determination, if required by applicable law, with respect to a claimant's
request Any indemnification under the first two paragraphs of this Section
(unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Company only as authorized in
the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director,
officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because the applicable
standard of conduct set forth in the first two paragraphs of this Section has
been met. Such determination shall be made: (1) by the Board of Directors by a
majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to such
action, suit or proceedings, even though less than a quorum; or (2) by a
committee of such directors designated by majority vote of such directors, even
though less than a quorum; or (3) if there are no such directors, or if such
directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion; or
(4) by the shareholders. The determination of a claimant's entitlement to
indemnification shall be made within a reasonable time, and in any event within
no more than 60 days, after receipt by the Company of a written request for
indemnification together with the supporting documentation required by this
Section. The burden of establishing that a claimant is not entitled to be
indemnified under this Article or otherwise shall be on the Company.

     Section 4. Payment of Expenses. Expenses incurred in defending a civil or
criminal action, suit or proceeding may shall be paid by the Company in advance
of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding within 30 days after
receipt by the Company of a statement requesting payment of such expenses. Such
statement shall evidence the expenses incurred by the claimant and shall include
an undertaking by or on behalf of the claimant to repay such expenses unless it
shall ultimately be determined,

Page 12 of 16

by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal,
that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company as authorized by this
Article. The burden of establishing that a claimant is not entitled to
payment of expenses under this Article or otherwise shall be on the Company. Any
such payment shall not be deemed to be a loan or extension or arrangement of
credit by or on behalf of the Company.

     Section 5. Provisions Non-Exclusive; Survival of Rights. The
indemnification and advancement payment of expenses provided by or granted
pursuant to this Section Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other
rights to which those indemnified or those who receive advances payment of
expenses may be entitled under any By-Law, agreement, vote of shareholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his an official
capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and
shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee
or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and
administrators of such a person.

     Section 6. Insurance. The Company shall have power to purchase and maintain
insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or
agent of the Company, or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him
and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such,
whether or not the Company would have the power to indemnify him against such
liability under the provisions of this Article.

expenses as provided in this Article.

                                   ARTICLE V
                                 MISCELLANEOUS

5.1 Unsecured General Creditor.  Participants and their heirs,  successors,  and
assigns  shall have no legal or  equitable  rights,  claims,  or interest in any
specific property or assets of the Employer.  No assets of the Employer shall be
held in any way as collateral  security for the fulfilling of the obligations of
the Employer under this Plan. Any and all of the Employer's assets shall be, and
remain,  the  general  unpledged,  unrestricted  assets  of  the  Employer.  The
Employer's  obligation  under the Plan shall be merely that of an  unfunded  and
unsecured promise of the Employer to pay money in the future,  and the rights of
the Participants  shall be no greater

                                       5

<PAGE>

than those of unsecured general  creditors.  It is the intention of the Employer
that this Plan be unfunded. Nothing contained in this Plan, and no actions taken
pursuant to the provisions of this Plan shall create or be construed to create a
trust  or any  kind of  fiduciary  relationship  between  the  Employer  and any
Participant or any other person.

5.2 Restriction Against  Assignment.  The Employer shall pay all amounts payable
hereunder  only to the person or persons  designated  by the Plan and not to any
other person or corporation.  No part of a Participant's benefit shall be liable
for the debts,  contracts,  or engagements  of any  Participant or successors in
interest,  nor shall a  Participant's  benefit be subject to  execution by levy,
attachment,  or garnishment or by any other legal or equitable  proceeding,  nor
shall any such person have any right to alienate,  anticipate,  sell,  transfer,
commute,  pledge,  encumber, or assign any benefits or payments hereunder in any
manner  whatsoever.  If any  Participant or successor in interest is adjudicated
bankrupt or purports to anticipate,  alienate, sell, transfer,  commute, assign,
pledge,   encumber  or  charge  any  distribution  or  payment  from  the  Plan,
voluntarily or involuntarily,  the Committee, in its discretion, may cancel such
distribution  or payment  (or any part  thereof)  to or for the  benefit of such
Participant  or  successor  in interest in such  manner as the  Committee  shall
direct.

5.3 Tax  Withholding.  There shall be deducted  from each payment made under the
Plan or any other  compensation  payable to the  Participant all taxes which are
required  to be withheld  by the  Employer in respect to any payment  under this
Plan. The Employer shall have the right to reduce any payment (or  compensation)
by the amount of cash sufficient to provide the amount of said taxes.

5.4 Amendment, Modification, Suspension or Termination. The Committee may amend,
modify,  suspend or terminate the Plan in whole or in part, at any time,  except
that no amendment,  modification,  suspension or termination  may  retroactively
adversely affect any Participant's right to a benefit which has vested under the
Plan before such date.

5.5 Governing Law. This Plan shall be construed,  governed and  administered  in
accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia, to the extent not preempted by
federal law, without regard to the conflicts of law principles thereof.

5.6 Receipt or Release.  Any payment to a  Participant  in  accordance  with the
provisions of the Plan shall, to the extent thereof,  be in full satisfaction of
all claims  against the Committee  and the  Employer.  The Committee may require
such Participant, as a condition precedent to such payment, to execute a receipt
and release to such effect.

5.7 Payments on Behalf of Persons Under Incapacity. In the event that any amount
becomes  payable  under the Plan to a person  who,  in the sole  judgment of the
Committee,  is considered by reason of physical or mental condition to be unable
to give a valid receipt therefore, the Committee may direct that such payment be
made to any person found by the Committee, in its sole judgment, to have assumed
the care of such person. Any payment made pursuant to such  determination  shall
constitute a full release and discharge of the Committee and the Employer.

                                       6
<PAGE>

5.8 Limitation of Rights and Employment Relationship.  Neither the establishment
of the Plan nor any modification  thereof, nor the creating of any fund, nor the
payment of any benefits shall be construed as giving to any Participant or other
person any legal or equitable  right against the Employer  except as provided in
the Plan;  and in no event  shall the terms of  employment  of any  Employee  or
Participant be modified or in any way be affected by the provisions of the Plan.

5.9 Headings. Headings and subheadings in this Plan are inserted for convenience
of  reference  only  and are not to be  considered  in the  construction  of the
provisions hereof.


The Coca-Cola Company  Supplemental Benefit Plan is hereby amended and restated,

                                                                EXHIBIT 10.10


                           EXECUTIVE MEDICAL PLAN OF
                             THE COCA-COLA COMPANY
                                 (PLAN NO. 549)

                            AS AMENDED AND RESTATED
                           EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2001

     The Coca-Cola  Company (the "Plan Sponsor")  adopted The Coca-Cola  Company
Supplemental  Medical  Expense  Plan on May 4, 1982 (the  "Plan").  On August 1,
1989, the Plan Sponsor  executed a Plan  Instrument  effective July 1, 1982. The
Plan was further  amended  effective  January 1, 1989 by  Amendment  No. 1 dated
August 1, 1989.

     The Plan Sponsor  does hereby  amend and restate the Plan in its  entirety,
effective as of January 1, 2001.  This  amendment and  restatement  reflects the
renaming of the Plan as the  "Executive  Medical Plan of The Coca-Cola  Company"
and the new Insurer for the Group Policy incorporated herein by reference.


1.   Purpose

     The  purpose  of the  Plan is to  provide  eligible  employees  of the Plan
Sponsor and its participating  affiliates with additional  financial security in
the event of death or disability.  An individual shall be treated as an employee
under  this Plan for any  period  only if (i) he or she is  actually  classified
during  such  period by the Plan  Sponsor or a  participating  affiliate  on its
payroll,  personnel  and benefits  system as an employee,  and (ii) he or she is
paid for  services  rendered  during such period  through the payroll  system as
distinguished  from the accounts  payable  department of the Plan Sponsor or any
participating  affiliate.  No other  individual  shall be treated as an employee
under  this Plan for any period  regardless  of his or her  status  during  such
period as an employee under common law or under any statute.

     The Plan Sponsor  intends  that the Plan  constitute  an "employee  welfare
benefit  plan" under the Employee  Retirement  Income  Security Act of 1974,  as
amended  ("ERISA")  and that  the  Plan be  maintained  in  compliance  with all
applicable  provisions  of ERISA  and the  Internal  Revenue  Code of  1986,  as
amended.

2.   Eligibility Requirements and Benefit Coverages Provided

     Benefits provided under the Plan shall be provided through the purchase and
maintenance of one or more Group  Insurance  Policies (the "Group Policy") which
the officers of the Plan Sponsor are  authorized  to enter into with one or more
insurance  companies (the "Insurer") with respect to the Plan. Plan requirements
respecting  eligibility for participation and benefits shall be the requirements
as to  employees  to be insured as set forth in the Group  Policy.  The  persons
entitled to benefits under the Plan shall be the employees  insured as set forth
in the Group Policy and their  beneficiaries  designated in accordance  with the
terms,  provisions  and  conditions of the Group Policy.  The benefits under the
Plan  shall be  provided  by the Group  Policy  in  accordance  with the  terms,
provisions  and  conditions  of the Group  Policy.  The  affiliates  of the Plan
Sponsor whose  employees may  participate in the Plan shall be those  affiliates
specified in the Group Policy.

<PAGE>

3.   Plan Administrator

     The  Director of Employee  Benefits of the Plan  Sponsor  shall be the Plan
Administrator of the Plan. The Plan Administrator may authorize any other person
to sign  communications  and to execute  documents  on his or her behalf and may
delegate  such of his or her duties and  responsibilities  under the Plan as the
Plan  Administrator  considers to be in the best interest of the Plan.  The Plan
Administrator  may employ one or more  persons to render  advice with respect to
any of the Plan Administrator's responsibilities under the Plan.

4.   Named Fiduciary and Administration of the Plan

     (a) The Plan  Administrator  shall have the  exclusive  responsibility  and
complete discretionary  authority to control the operation and management of the
Plan, with all powers  necessary to enable him or her to properly carry out such
responsibility,  including,  but not limited to, the power to construe the terms
of this Plan, to determine status, coverage and eligibility for benefits (except
to the extent  delegated to the Insurer under Section 4(b) of the Plan),  and to
resolve all interpretive,  equitable and other questions that shall arise in the
operation and administration of the Plan. All actions and determinations made by
the Plan Administrator shall be final, conclusive and binding on all persons.

     (b) Claims for  benefits  under the Plan are to be submitted to and payment
of claims will be made by the Insurer as provided in the Group  Policy.  A claim
which is denied by the Insurer  shall be  reviewed by the Insurer in  accordance
with the  procedure  as provided in the Group  Policy,  and the  decision of the
Insurer on any claim shall be final. The Insurer shall be the "named  fiduciary"
under the Plan for the purpose of such  review and all  decisions  thereon.  The
Insurer's  decision on any claim shall be final,  conclusive  and binding on all
persons.  Except as provided in Section 4(c) of the Plan, the Insurer shall have
the exclusive  responsibility and complete  discretionary  authority to make all
decisions  with  respect to claims,  with all powers  necessary  to enable it to
properly carry out such responsibility, including, but not limited to, the power
to construe the terms of the Group  Policy,  to determine  status,  coverage and
eligibility of claims,  and to resolve all interpretive and other questions that
shall arise while doing so. All such  actions or  determinations  of the Insurer
shall be final, conclusive and binding on all persons.

     (c)  Notwithstanding  Section  4(b),  the Plan  Administrator,  and not the
Insurer,  shall have the  exclusive  responsibility  and complete  discretionary
authority to determine  whether an  individual  has been  classified on the Plan
Sponsor's or a participating affiliate's payroll,  personnel and benefits system
for any period as its employee for purposes of this Plan and shall be the "named
fiduciary" under the Plan for such purpose.  All actions and determinations made
by the Plan  Administrator  in the scope of his or her authority  under the Plan
shall be final, conclusive and binding on all persons.

5.   Plan Year

     The plan year for the Plan shall coincide with the policy year of the Group
Policy.

6.   Financing the Plan

     All Plan benefits shall be funded through the purchase of the Group Policy;
provided,  however,  that any payments made to or credits to the Plan Sponsor in
accordance with the experience  rating  provisions,  if any, of the Group Policy
shall be the separate property of the Plan Sponsor.  Eligible  employees covered
under the Plan shall make such  contributions to the cost of the Group Policy as
the Plan Administrator may require from time to time.

7.   Plan Expenses

     All reasonable and proper expenses incurred in administering the Plan shall
be paid by the Plan unless the Plan Sponsor, in its absolute discretion,  elects
to pay any or all of such expenses.

8.   Limitation of Rights

     The Plan shall not give any  employee,  former  employee or  dependent  any
right or claim except to the extent that such right is specifically  fixed under
the terms of the Plan. Neither the establishment nor the continuance of the Plan
shall be  construed as giving any employee a right to be continued in the employ
of the Plan  Sponsor or any  affiliate or as  interfering  with the right of the
Plan Sponsor or any affiliate to terminate the employment of any employee at any
time.

9.   Failure of Enforcement as Waiver

     The failure of the Plan Sponsor, the Plan Administrator,  or the Insurer to
enforce at any time any of the provisions of the Plan, or to require at any time
performance of any of the  provisions of the Plan,  shall in no way be construed
to be a waiver of such provisions,  nor in any way to effect the validity of the
Plan or any part thereof or the right of the Plan Sponsor,  Plan  Administrator,
or Insurer to thereafter enforce each and every such provision.

10.  Amendment and Termination of the Plan

     The Plan Administrator may terminate,  suspend, amend or modify the Plan in
whole or part at any time for any  reason  (including,  without  limitation,  to
reduce or eliminate coverage for one or more groups of individuals and to change
or increase at any time the amounts  payable by covered  persons  under the Plan
including,  without limitation,  the amounts of contributions  required for Plan
coverage), by written action, and any such termination, suspension, amendment or
modification may be made retroactively and, further, may be made without advance
notice to any person;  provided,  however,  that no  amendment to the benefit or
other  provisions  of the Group  Policy may be made  without the approval of the
Insurer.

11.  Applicable Law

     The Plan shall be  construed,  administered  and  governed in all  respects
under and by the laws of the State of Georgia, except to the extent that Federal
law is controlling.

                               POLICY PROVISIONS

                                 Premium Rates

The monthly premium for each insured Employee is as follows:

*    $253.52 for Employee only coverage.

*    $519.19 for Employee plus Spouse coverage.

*    $732.15 for Employee plus Family coverage.


                    The Company's Right to Change the Rates

The Company can change the premium rates on:

*    A Premium Due Date.

*    The date of a change in Plan benefits or provisions.

*    The effective date of any change in federal laws or state regulations which
     affect the Company's obligations under this policy.

The Company also has the right to change the rates  retroactive to the Effective
Date  if an  Employee  makes  a  material  misrepresentation  that  affects  the
conditions under which the policy was issued.

However,  the Company may not increase the rates before  either of the following
times,  except for an  increase  due to a change in the number of  Employees,  a
change in Plan,  a change  in  federal  laws or state  regulations  or  Employee
misrepresentation:

The first Policy Anniversary.

12 months after a previous increase in premium rates.

The  Employer  will be notified  at least 60 days in advance of any  increase in
premium rates.

                        Premiums: Where and How Payable

Premium is the money paid by the Employer to the Company for insurance coverage.
Premiums are paid at the Home Office or to an  authorized  agent of the Company.
Premiums are paid in advance each month on or before the Premium Due Date except
that premiums for each conversion policy or certificate issued during a calendar
quarter are paid to the Company quarterly in arrears.

The  first  premium  is due on and  must be paid  by the  Effective  Date of the
policy.


                       Premium Computation and Adjustment

Premium Computation

Each  monthly  premium  is  calculated  based on the number of  enrollees,  each
enrollee's coverage  classification the Company shows in its records at the time
of the calculation and the premium rates then in effect.

<PAGE>



The Employer shall notify the Company in writing within 30 days of the effective
date of additions,  terminations or other changes. The Employer shall notify the
Company in writing each month of any changes in the coverage  classification  of
any enrollee.

Premium Adjustment

The Company will make a retroactive adjustment of the premium for any additions,
terminations  or changes in coverage  classification  not shown in the Company's
records at the time premium is calculated.

No retroactive credit will be made for:

*    any change  which  occurs more than 60 days prior to the date the  Employer
     notifies the Company of the change

*    any month in which an individual  has received  services or supplies  under
     the terms of the policy.

The Employer  may notify the Company in writing to end the policy  during a time
for which  premium has been paid.  The Company  will make an  adjustment  of the
premium to the  Employer  for the time  between the date the policy ends and the
end of the period for which premium has been paid.


                              Retrospective Rating

Insurance under this policy is subject to retrospective  experience rating. This
means that the Company may at the end of any policy year retrospectively reduce,
but not increase, the premium for such policy year due to claims experience. The
claims  experience of the class of business as a whole, of which the Employer is
a part, and to the extent allowed by law, the claims experience of each Employer
under this policy will be used to  determine  the premium  rates.  To the extent
allowed  by law,  the  rates  may also be based on some or all of the  following
characteristics  of  the  Employer:   age,  sex,  family  status,   industry  or
occupation,  size  of  the  Employer,  location  of the  Employer,  underwriting
classification,  duration  of  coverage  since  underwriting,  health  status of
covered individuals,  benefit plan design, and such other factors as the Company
may determine from time to time.


                                  Grace Period

This  section  applies  only to  premiums  due after the  Effective  Date of the
policy.

If  premiums  are not paid by a Premium  Due Date,  the policy will only stay in
force for 31 days.  The Employer must pay premiums for the time the policy stays
in force.  If written  notice to end the policy is given by the Employer  before
the end of the 31 days, an adjustment of the premium will be made.


                       Employee's Individual Certificate

The Company will issue  Certificates  of Insurance  and any  attachments  to the
Employer  for  delivery  to  each  covered  Employee.  The  certificate  and any
attachments  will show all the benefits and  provisions of the health  insurance
plan.


                         Employer's Information Reports

The Company needs  certain  data. It is used to figure  amounts of insurance and
premiums. The Employer must give the data when it is requested by the Company.


<PAGE>




                      Inspection of Records by the Company

The Company has the right to inspect  records of the Employer that relate to the
insurance or the  premiums.  The Company will have this right at all  reasonable
times.


                                Entire Contract

This policy is governed by the laws of the State or other Jurisdiction of Issue.
The entire contract is made up of the following:

*    This policy, including all Certificates and any attachments.

*    The Employer's application,

*    The Employees' applications, if there are any.

Unless there is fraud,  all statements made by the Employer or Employees will be
considered as statements of fact, not as guarantees.

A covered  person's  statement  can not be used in defense to a claim  under the
policy unless a copy of the statement has been given to the person.


                                 Clerical Error

Clerical  error shall not  deprive  any person of  coverage  under the policy or
create a right to  benefits.  Failure  to report the  termination  of a person's
coverage shall not continue such coverage beyond the date it is scheduled to end
according to the terms of the policy.  Upon discovery of a clerical  error,  any
necessary appropriate  adjustment in premium shall be made. However, the Company
will not make an  adjustment  in  premium or  coverage  for more than 60 days of
coverage  prior to the date the Employer  notifies the Company of such  clerical
error.

                                 Modifications

No one can change the  policy,  any of its  conditions  or the  Premium Due Date
without the written consent of the Company.

The Company can change the policy  (including the benefits and provisions in the
Certificates of Insurance) on a Policy Anniversary. The change must be effective
on a uniform  basis on all policies  which provide the same type of group health
product in the small  and/or  large  group  market.  Employer  agreement  is not
needed.

The policy can also be changed if the Company and the Employer  agree.  Employee
agreement is not needed.

Any  change  has to agree  with the laws of the State or other  Jurisdiction  of
Issue.

Any change has to be signed by an Officer of the  Company  and  attached to this
policy before it is valid.

Benefits  can not be  reduced  for an  expense  incurred  before the date of the
change.

*    The date the  premium  is not paid  when due.  Unless  the  Employer  gives
     advance  written notice to the Company to end the policy,  the Grace Period
     applies. During the Grace Period the policy stays in force for 31 days. The
     Employer must pay premium for the time the policy stays in force. The Grace
     Period applies even if the Employer  replaces this policy with another plan
     of insurance but has not given notice to the Company.

*    The first  Premium Due Date after the  Employer  gives the Company  written
     notice to end the policy.  If the Employer does not give advance notice and

         intentional  misrepresentation  of material fact under the terms of the
         policy.  The Company  has the right to rescind  this policy back to the
         effective date.

       * The  Employer  has  failed  to  comply  with  the  Company's   employer
         contribution or group participation rules.

       * The number of Employees  changes such that a large  employer  becomes a
         small employer.  The small employer will be given the option to buy all
         other group  health  coverage  currently  offered by the Company in the
         small group market.

       * The Company has stopped  issuance of the type of group health  coverage
         provided  by this  policy in a state for the small  and/or  large group
         market.  The  Company  will give notice of the  discontinuation  to the
         Employer  and  Employees  at  least  90 days  prior  to the date of the
         discontinuation.  The Employer will be given the option to buy all (or,

Policy.  All statements made by the Enrolling Group or by a Subscriber shall, in
the absence of fraud, be deemed representations and not warranties.

Section 5.2 Time Limit on Certain  Defenses.  No statement,  except a fraudulent
statement, made by the Enrolling Group shall be used to void the Policy after it
has been in force for a period of two years.

Section 5.3 Amendments and  Alterations.  Amendments to the Policy are effective
upon 31 days written notice to the Enrolling Group.  Riders are effective on the
date specified by the Company. No change will be made to the Policy unless it is

agent has authority to change the Policy or to waive any of its provisions.

Section 5.4 Relationship Between Parties. The relationships  between the Company
and providers and relationships  between the company and Enrolling  Groups,  are
solely  contractual  relationships  between  independent  contractors.   Network
providers and Enrolling  Groups are not agents or employees of the Company,  nor
is the Company or any  employee of the Company an agent or employee of providers
or Enrolling Groups.

The  relationship  between a provider and any Covered Person is that of provider
and patient. The provider is solely responsible for the services provided to any
Covered Person.

The  relationship  between the  Enrolling  Group and Covered  Persons is that of
employer and employee,  Dependent or other Coverage classification as defined in
the  Policy.  The  Enrolling  Group is solely  responsible  for  enrollment  and
Coverage  classification  changes  (including  termination of a Covered Person's
Coverage  through the Company),  for the timely  payment of the Policy Charge to
the Company, and for notifying Covered Persons of the termination of the Policy.

Section 5.5  Records.  You must  furnish the Company  with all  information  and
proofs which it may reasonably  require regarding any matters  pertaining to the
Policy.

By accepting  Coverage under the Policy,  you authorize and direct any person or
institution  that has  provided  services to you, to furnish the Company any and
all  information  and  records or copies of  records  relating  to the  services
provided to you.  The Company has the right to request this  information  at any
reasonable  time.  This  applies  to all  Covered  Persons,  including  Enrolled
Dependents whether or not they have signed the Subscriber's enrollment form.

GP(99)
                                       10

The  Company  agrees  that  such  information  and  records  will be  considered
confidential.  The  Company  has the  right  to  release  any  and  all  records
concerning  health care services which are necessary to implement and administer
the terms of the Policy or for appropriate medical review or quality assessment.

The  Company is  permitted  to charge  you  reasonable  fees to cover  costs for
completing requested medical abstracts or forms which you have requested.

In some cases,  the Company will designate  other persons or entities to request
records or  information  from or related to you and to release  those records as
necessary.  The Company's  designees have the same rights to this information as
does the Company.

During and after the term of the Policy,  the  Company and its related  entities
may use and transfer the information  gathered under the Policy for research and
analytic purposes.

Section  5.6  ERISA.  When the Policy is  purchased  by the  Enrolling  Group to
provide benefits under a welfare plan governed by the Employee Retirement Income
Security  Act 29 U.S.C.  [Section]  1001 et seq.,  the  Company  is not the plan
administrator or named fiduciary of the welfare plan, as those terms are used in
ERISA.

Section 5.7 Clerical Error.  If a clerical error or other mistake  occurs,  that
error shall not deprive you of Coverage under the Policy.  A clerical error also
does not create a right to benefits.

Section  5.8  Notice.   When  the  Company  provides  written  notice  regarding
administration  of the Policy to an authorized  representative  of the Enrolling
Group,  that  notice is  deemed  notice to all  affected  Subscribers  and their
Enrolled  Dependents.  The Enrolling  Group is responsible  for giving notice to
Covered Persons.

Section 5.9 Workers' Compensation Not Affected.  The Coverage provided under the
Policy does not substitute for and does not affect any requirements for coverage
by workers' compensation insurance.

Section 5.10 Conformity with Statutes. Any provision of the Policy which, on its
effective  date,  is in  conflict  with the  requirements  of  state or  federal
statutes or  regulations  (of the  jurisdiction  in which  delivered)  is hereby
amended to conform to the minimum requirements of such statutes and regulations.

SECTION 6

COORDINATION OF BENEFITS

Section  6.1  Coordination  of  Benefits  Applicability.  This  coordination  of
benefits (COB) provision applies when a person has health care coverage under

GP(99)
                                       11

<PAGE>

more than one Coverage Plan.  "Coverage Plan" is defined below.

The order of benefit  determination  rules below  determine  which Coverage Plan
will pay as the primary Coverage Plan. The primary Coverage Plan that pays first
pays without regard to the possibility that another Coverage Plan may cover some
expenses. A secondary Coverage Plan pays after the primary Coverage Plan and may
reduce the benefits it pays so that  payments from all group  Coverage  Plans do
not exceed 100% of the total allowable expense.

Section  6.2  Definitions.  For  purposes  of Section  6,  terms are  defined as
follows:

A.   A  "Coverage  Plan"  is any of the  following  that  provides  benefits  or
     services  for medical or dental  care or  treatment.  However,  if separate
     contracts are used to provide coordinated  coverage for members of a group,
     the separate  contracts are considered  parts of the same Coverage Plan and
     there is no COB among those separate contracts.

     1.   "Plan" includes: group insurance, closed panel or other forms of group
          or group-type  coverage  (whether insured or uninsured);  medical care
          components of group long-term care contracts,  such as skilled nursing
          care; medical benefits under group or individual automobile contracts;
          and Medicare or other governmental benefits, as permitted by law.

     2.   "Plan" does not include:  individual or family insurance; closed panel
          or other individual coverage (except for group-type coverage);  school
          accident type coverage;  benefits for non-medical  components of group
          long-term  care  policies;   Medicare  supplement  policies,  Medicaid
          policies and coverage under other governmental plans, unless permitted
          by law.

     Each contract for coverage under (1) or (2) is a separate Coverage Plan. If
          a Coverage  Plan has two parts and COB rules  apply only to one of the
          two, each of the parts is treated as a separate Coverage Plan.

B.   The order of benefit  determination  rules determine  whether this Coverage
     Plan is a  "primary  Coverage  Plan"  or  "secondary  Coverage  Plan"  when
     compared to another Coverage Plan covering the person.

     When this  Coverage  Plan is primary,  its benefits are  determined  before
     those of any other Coverage Plan and without considering any other coverage
     Plan's  benefits.  When this Coverage  Plan is secondary,  its benefits are
     determined  after those of another Coverage Plan and may be reduced because
     of the primary Coverage Plan's benefits.

C.   "Allowable  expense"  means a health  care  service or  expense,  including
     deductibles and copayments,  that is covered at least in part by any of the
     Coverage Plans covering the person.  When a Coverage Plan provides benefits
     in the form of services, (for example an HMO) the reasonable

CB(99)
                                       12
<PAGE>

     cash value of each service will be  considered  an allowable  expense and a
     benefit  paid.  An  expense or  service  that is not  covered by any of the
     Coverage Plans is not an allowable  expense.  The following are examples of
     expenses or services that are not allowable expenses:

     1.   If a  covered  person is  confined  in a private  hospital  room,  the
          difference between the cost of a semi-private room in the hospital and
          the private  room,  (unless the patient's  stay in a private  hospital
          room is medically  necessary in terms of  generally  accepted  medical
          practice, or one of the Coverage Plans routinely provides coverage for
          hospital private rooms) is not an allowable expense.

     2.   If a person is covered by 2 or more Coverage  Plans that compute their
          benefit  payments on the basis of reasonable  and customary  fees, any
          amount in excess of the highest of the  reasonable  and customary fees
          for a specific benefit is not an allowable expense.

     3.   If a person  is  covered  by 2 or more  Coverage  Plans  that  provide
          benefits  or services on the basis of  negotiated  fees,  an amount in
          excess  of the  highest  of the  negotiated  fees is not an  allowable
          expense.

     4.   If a person  is  covered  by one  Coverage  Plan that  calculates  its
          benefits or services on the basis of reasonable and customary fees and
          another  Coverage  Plan that  provides its benefits or services on the
          basis  of  negotiated   fees,  the  primary  Coverage  Plan's  payment
          arrangements shall be the allowable expense for all Coverage Plans.

     5.   The amount a benefit is reduced by the primary Coverage Plan because a
          covered  person does not comply  with the  Coverage  Plan  provisions.
          Examples   of  these   provisions   are  second   surgical   opinions,
          precertification of admissions, and preferred provider arrangements.

D.   "Claim  determination  period" means a calendar year.  However, it does not
     include any part of a year during which a person has no coverage under this
     Coverage Plan, or before the date this COB provision or a similar provision
     takes effect.

E.   "Closed  panel  Coverage  Plan" is a  Coverage  Plan that  provides  health
     benefits to covered  persons  primarily  in the form of services  through a
     panel  of  providers  that  have  contracted  with or are  employed  by the
     Coverage Plan, and that limits or excludes  benefits for services  provided
     by other  provider,  except in cases of  emergency  or  referral by a panel
     member.

F.   "Custodial parent" means a parent awarded custody by a court decree. In the
     absence of a court decree, it is the parent with whom the child resides

CB(99)
                                       13
<PAGE>

     more than  one  half  of the  calendar  year  without  regard  to any
     temporary visitation.


Section  6.3 Order of Benefit  Determination  Rules.  When two or more  Coverage
Plans pay  benefits,  the  rules for  determining  the order of  payment  are as
follows:

A.   The primary Coverage Plan pays or provides its benefits as if the secondary
     Coverage Plan or Coverage Plans did not exist.

B.   A Coverage Plan that does not contain a coordination of benefits  provision
     that is  consistent  with this  provision is always  primary.  There is one
     exception:  coverage  that is obtained by virtue of  membership  in a group
     that is designed to  supplement  a part of a basic  package of benefits may
     provide that the supplementary  coverage shall be excess to any other parts
     of the Coverage  Plan  provided by the contract  holder.  Examples of these
     types of situations are major medical  coverages that are superimposed over
     base  Coverage  Plan hospital and surgical  benefits,  and  insurance  type
     coverages that are written in connection  with a closed panel Coverage Plan
     to provide out-of-network benefits.

C.   A Coverage  Plan may  consider  the  benefits  paid or  provided by another
     Coverage Plan in determining its benefits only when it is secondary to that
     other Coverage Plan.

D.   The first of the following  rules that  describes  which Coverage Plan pays
     its benefits before another Coverage Plan is the rule to use.

     1.   Non-Dependent  or Dependent.  The Coverage Plan that covers the person
          other  than  as a  dependent,  for  example  as an  employee,  member,
          subscriber or retiree is primary and the Coverage Plan that covers the
          person  as a  dependent  is  secondary.  However,  if the  person is a
          Medicare  beneficiary  and,  as a result of federal  law,  Medicare is
          secondary to the Coverage Plan covering the person as a dependent; and
          primary  to the  Coverage  Plan  covering  the  person as other than a
          dependent  (e.g.  a  retired  employee);  then the  order of  benefits
          between the two Coverage  Plans is reversed so that the Coverage  Plan
          covering the person as an employee,  member,  subscriber or retiree is
          secondary and the other Coverage Plan is primary.

     2.   Child Covered  Under More Than One Plan.  The order of benefits when a
          child is covered by more than one Coverage Plan is:

          a.   The  primary  Coverage  Plan is the  Coverage  Plan of the parent
               whose birthday is earlier in the year if:

               1)   the parents are married;

               2)   the parents are not separated (whether or not they

CB(99)
                                       14
<PAGE>

                  ever have been married;  or
               3)  a court decree awards joint custody  without
                   specifying  that one party has the responsibility to provide
                   health care coverage.

               If  both parents have the same  birthday,  the Coverage  Plan
               that covered either of the parents longer is primary.

          b.   If the  specific  terms of a court  decree  state that one of the
               parents is  responsible  for the child's  health care expenses or
               health care  coverage  and the  Coverage  Plan of that parent has
               actual  knowledge of those terms,  that Coverage Plan is primary.
               This rule applies to claim determination periods or Coverage Plan
               years  commencing  after the Coverage Plan is given notice of the
               court decree.

          c.   If the parents are not married,  or are separated (whether or not
               they  ever  have  been  married)  or are  divorced,  the order of
               benefits is:

               1)   the Coverage Plan of the custodial parent;

               2)   the Coverage Plan of the spouse of the custodial parent;

               3)   the Coverage Plan of the noncustodial parent; and then

               4)   the Coverage Plan of the spouse of the noncustodial parent.

     3.   Continuation  coverage. If a person whose coverage is provided under a
          right of continuation provided by federal or state law also is covered
          under another  Coverage Plan, the Coverage Plan covering the person as
          an  employee,  member,  subscriber  or  retiree  (or as that  person's
          dependent) is primary, and the continuation coverage is secondary.  If
          the other  Coverage Plan does not have this rule, and if, as a result,
          the Coverage Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is
          ignored.

     4.   Longer or shorter  length of coverage.  The Coverage Plan that covered
          the person as an employee,  member,  subscriber  or retiree  longer is
          primary.

     5.   If the preceding rules do not determine the primary Coverage Plan, the
          allowable  expenses shall be shared equally between the Coverage Plans
          meeting the  definition  of  Coverage  Plan under this  provision.  In
          addition, this Coverage Plan will not pay more than it would have paid
          had it been primary.

CB(99)
                                       15

Section 6.4  Effect on the Benefits of This Coverage Plan.

A.   When this Coverage  Plan is  secondary,  it may reduce its benefits so that
     the total  benefits  paid or provided by all Coverage  Plans during a claim
     determination  period  are not more  than 100  percent  of total  allowable
     expenses.  The difference  between the benefit  payments that this Coverage
     Plan would have paid had it been the primary Coverage Plan, and the benefit
     payments that it actually  paid or provided  shall be recorded as a benefit
     reserve for the covered  person and used by this  Coverage  Plan to pay any
     allowable  expenses,  not  otherwise  paid  during the claim  determination
     period. As each claim is submitted, this Coverage Plan will:

     1.   determine  its  obligation  to  pay  or  provide  benefits  under  its
          contract;

     2.   determine  whether a benefit reserve has been recorded for the covered
          person; and

     3.   determine whether there are any unpaid allowable  expenses during that
          claims determination period.

          If there is a benefit  reserve,  the secondary  Coverage Plan will use
          the  covered  person's  benefit  reserve  to pay up to 100%  of  total
          allowable expenses incurred during the claim determination  period. At
          the  end of the  claims  determination  period,  the  benefit  reserve
          returns to zero.  A new benefit  reserve  must be created for each new
          claim determination period.

B.   If a covered  person is enrolled in two or more closed panel Coverage plans
     and if, for any reason,  including  the provision of service by a non-panel
     provider,  benefits are not payable by one closed panel  Coverage Plan, COB
     shall not apply between that coverage Plan and other closed panel  Coverage
     Plans.

Section 6.5 Right to Receive and Release Needed Information. Certain facts about
health care  coverage  and  services  are needed to apply these COB rules and to
determine  benefits  payable under this Coverage Plan and other Coverage  Plans.
The Company may get the facts it needs from or give them to other  organizations
or persons  for the purpose of applying  these  rules and  determining  benefits
payable under this Coverage Plan and other  Coverage  Plans  covering the person
claiming benefits.  The Company need not tell, or get the consent of, any person
to do this.  The company need not tell,  or get the consent of, any person to do
this.  Each person  claiming  benefits  under this  Coverage  Plan must give the
Company any facts it needs to apply those rules and determine  benefits payable.
If you do not provide the Company the  information it needs to apply these rules
and determine the benefits payable, your claim for benefits will be denied.


CB(99)
                                       16
<PAGE>

Section 6.6  Payments  Made.  A payment  made under  another  Coverage  Plan may
include an amount  that should have been paid under this  Coverage  Plan.  If it
does, the Company may pay that amount to the organization that made the payment.
That  amount  will then be treated  as though it were a benefit  paid under this
Coverage  Plan.  The Company  will not have to pay that amount  again.  The term
"payment made"  includes  providing  benefits in the form of services,  in which
case "payment made" means reasonable cash value of the benefits  provided in the
form of services.

Section 6.7 Right of Recovery. If the amount of the payments made by the Company
is more than it should  have paid under this COB  provision,  it may recover the
excess from one or more of the  persons it had paid or for whom it has paid;  or
any other person or  organization  that may be  responsible  for the benefits or
services  provided for the covered  person.  The "amount of the  payments  made"
includes  the  reasonable  cash value of any  benefits  provided  in the form of
services.

SECTION 7

CONTINUATION OF COVERAGE

Section 7.1  Continuation  Coverage.  A Covered Person whose Coverage ends under
the Policy may be entitled to elect  continuation  Coverage in  accordance  with
federal law (under  COBRA) and as outlined in Sections 9.2 through 9.4 below [or
in accordance with state law and as outlined in Sections 9.5 - 9.7 below].

Continuation  Coverage under COBRA (Consolidated  Omnibus Budget  Reconciliation
Act) shall apply only to Enrolling Groups which are subject to the provisions of
COBRA.  Covered Persons should contact the Enrolling Group's plan  administrator
to determine if he or she is entitled to continue  Coverage under COBRA. For the
purpose of continuation Coverage under COBRA, a newborn child of a Subscriber or
a  child  placed  for  adoption  with  the  Subscriber   during  the  period  of
continuation coverage shall be considered on the same basis as a Subscriber.

Continuation  Coverage for Covered  Persons who selected  continuation  coverage
under a prior  plan  which was  replaced  by  Coverage  under the  Policy  shall
terminate  as  scheduled  under  the  prior  plan  or  in  accordance  with  the
terminating events set forth in Section 9.4 below, whichever is earlier.

In no event shall the Company be obligated to provide continuation Coverage to a
Covered Person if the Enrolling Group or its designated plan administrator fails
to perform  its  responsibilities  under  federal  law.  These  responsibilities
include but are not limited to notifying  the Covered  Person in a timely manner
of the right to elect  continuation  Coverage  and  notifying  the  Company in a
timely manner of the Covered Person's election of continuation Coverage.


CB(99)
                                       17
<PAGE>

It is the  Subscriber's  responsibility  to notify the Enrolling Group within 60
days of the date an Enrolled  Dependent loses  eligibility due to divorce or due
to an Enrolled  Dependent child losing  eligibility (i.e.  reaching the limiting
age or failing to meet the  criteria  of a  Full-time  Student.)  If you fail to
notify  the  Enrolling  Group of these  events  within  the 60 day  period,  the
Enrolling  Group and its  designated  plan  administrator  are not  obligated to
provide continuation Coverage for that Enrolled Dependent.

The Company is not the Enrolling Group's  designated Plan Administrator and does
not assume any responsibilities of a Plan Administrator pursuant to federal law.

A Covered  Person whose  Coverage  would  otherwise  end under the Policy may be
entitled to elect  continuation  Coverage in  accordance  with  federal  law, as
outlined in Sections 9.2 through 9.4 below.

Section 7.2 Qualifying  Events for  Continuation  Coverage Under Federal Law. If
the Covered Person's Coverage terminated due to one of the following  qualifying
events, he or she is entitled to continue Coverage. The Covered Person may elect
the same Coverage that he or she had at the time of the qualifying event.


A.   Termination of the Subscriber  from  employment with the Enrolling Group or
     reduction of hours, for any reason other than gross misconduct; or

B.   death of the Subscriber; or

C.   divorce or legal separation of the Subscriber; or

D.   loss of eligibility by an Enrolled Dependent who is a child; or

E.   entitlement of the Subscriber to Medicare benefits; or

F.   the Enrolling  Group filing for  bankruptcy,  under Title XI, United States
     Code, on or after July 1, 1986,  but only for a retired  Subscriber and his
     or her Enrolled Dependents. This is also a qualifying event for any retired
     Subscriber  and his or her Enrolled  Dependents  if there is a  substantial

Continuation under the Policy will end on the earliest of the following dates:

A.   Eighteen months from the date continuation began for a Covered Person whose
     Coverage ended because employment was terminated or hours were reduced,  in
     accordance  with  qualifying  event (A) described in Section 9.2. A Covered
     Person who is  disabled at the time of the  qualifying  event or within the
     first 60 days of continuation  Coverage may extend continuation Coverage to
     a maximum of 29 months as described below.

     A Covered  Person who is  disabled at the date of  qualifying  event (A) or

     determination of the disability,  and in no event later than the end of the
     first 18 months,  in order to extend  Coverage  beyond 18  months.  If such
     notice is provided,  the Covered Person's  Coverage may be extended up to a
     maximum  of 29 months  from the date of  qualifying  event (A) or until the
     first  month  that  begins  more  than 30 days  after the date of any final

     qualified  beneficiary  is no  longer  disabled  within  30  days  of  such
     determination.

B.   Thirty-six  months  from  the  date  continuation  began  for  an  Enrolled
     Dependent  whose  Coverage  ended  because of the death of the  Subscriber,
     divorce or legal  separation of the  Subscriber,  loss of eligibility by an
     Enrolled  Dependent  who is a child or  entitlement  of the  Subscriber  to
     Medicare  benefits,  in accordance with qualifying  events (B), (C), (D) or

     payment of the Premium.

D.   The date,  after  electing  continuation  Coverage,  that coverage is first
     obtained  under any other group health plan.  If such  coverage  contains a
     limitation or exclusion  with respect to any  preexisting  condition of the
     Covered  Person,  continuation  shall  end on the date such  limitation  or
     exclusion  ends.  The other group health  coverage shall be primary for all
     health  services  except  those  health  services  that are  subject to the
     preexisting condition limitation or exclusion.

E.   The date,  after electing  continuation  Coverage,  that the Covered Person
     first becomes entitled to Medicare, except that this shall not apply in the
     event the Covered  Person's  Coverage was terminated  because the Enrolling
     Group  filed  for  bankruptcy,  in  accordance  with  qualifying  event (F)
     described in Section 9.2.

F.   The date the entire Policy ends.

G.   The date Coverage would otherwise terminate under the Policy.

If a Covered  Person is  entitled  to 18  months  of  continuation  and a second
qualifying event occurs during that time, the Covered  Person's  Coverage may be
extended  up to a maximum  of 36 months  from the date  Coverage  ended  because
employment was terminated or hours were reduced,  in accordance  with qualifying
event (A)  described  in  Section  9.2.  If a  Covered  Person  is  entitled  to
continuation  because the Enrolling  Group filed for  bankruptcy,  in accordance
with  qualifying  event (F) described in Section 9.2 and the retired  Subscriber
dies during the continuation  period, the Enrolled  Dependents shall be entitled
to continue  Coverage for 36 months from the date of death.  Terminating  events
(B) through (G)  described  in this  Section 9.4 shall apply during the extended
continuation period.

Continuation Coverage for Enrolled Dependents of a Subscriber whose continuation
Coverage  terminates  because the Subscriber becomes entitled to Medicare may be
extended for an additional  period of time.  Such Covered Persons should contact

the continuation period.

The Coca-Cola Company established this Supplemental Benefit Plan (the "Plan")

plans maintained by The Coca-Cola Company as a result of the limitations set
forth under certain applicable sections of the Internal Revenue Code or on
account of an employee's deferral of compensation under The Coca-Cola Company
Deferred Compensation Plan.

This plan is amended and restated effective January 1, 2002, incorporating any

or retires on or after January 1, 2002 shall be determined under the terms of

                                   ELIGIBIILTY

Pension Plan are limited by the limitations set forth in Code Sections
401(a)(17) and/or 415, (b) for whom contributions by the Employer to the

Each Employee who is eligible to become a Participant under Section 2.1 shall

                                    BENEFITS

3.1 Supplemental Pension Benefit.

(a) Benefit.

     (1)  If a Participant has Years of Benefit Service as defined in the
          Qualified Pension Plan of the Employer, he shall be entitled to a
          Supplemental Pension Benefit equal to that portion of his Retirement
          Benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan of the Employer which is not
          payable under such Qualified Pension Plan as a result of the
          limitations imposed by Code Sections 401(a)(17) and 415.

     (2)  If a Participant has Years of Benefit Service as defined in the
          Qualified Pension Plan of the Employer and if a Participant has
          deferred compensation under the Deferred Compensation Plan, he shall
          be entitled to a Supplemental Pension Benefit equal to that portion of
          his Retirement Benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan of the
          Employer which is not payable under such Qualified Pension Plan solely
          on account of the fact that deferred compensation is not considered

                                       4
<PAGE>


          Benefit Compensation (as defined in the Qualified Pension Plan of the
          Employer) for purposes of the Qualified Pension Plan.

     (3)  In no event (except in the event that compensation is calculated under
          Section 3.1(a)(5), below) shall the sum of i) the Supplemental Pension
          Benefit and ii) the actual Retirement Benefit paid under the Qualified
          Pension Plan exceed the amount of Retirement Benefit determined under
          the Qualified Pension Plan had compensation not been deferred under
          the Deferred Compensation Plan and without regard to limitations
          imposed by the Code.

     (4)  For purposes of this Section 3.1, the Supplemental Pension Benefit of
          a Participant shall be calculated based on the Participant's
          compensation that is considered under the Qualified Pension Plan in
          calculating his Retirement Benefit, without regard to the limitation
          of Code Section 401(a)(17) and by taking into consideration
          compensation that would have been considered benefit-eligible
          compensation under the Qualified Pension Plan had the Participant not
          elected to defer such amounts.

     (5)  If a Participant was on an Approved Leave of Absence, as defined under
          the Qualified Pension Plan, for the purpose of working for another
          entity within The Coca-Cola system, his Supplemental Pension Benefit
          under this Plan shall be calculated based on compensation paid as
          follows: compensation during the Approved Leave of Absence shall be
          the greater of i) compensation as determined under the first sentence
          of this paragraph 3.1(a)(4) or ii) compensation actually paid to the
          Participant by the other entity within The Coca-Cola system during the
          Approved Leave of Absence, subject to the same inclusions and
          exclusions to benefit compensation under the Qualified Pension Plan,
          but without regard to the limitation of Code Section 401(a)(17). The
          Committee may require that the Participant provide satisfactory
          evidence of such compensation.

     (6)  Any benefit payable pursuant to this Section 3.1 shall be offset by
          the monthly benefit, if any, payable to a Participant under The
          Coca-Cola Company Key Executive Retirement Plan. The Supplemental
          Pension Benefit calculated under this Section 3.1 shall also be offset
          by the value of benefits to which the Participant is entitled under
          any other retirement plan (other than the Qualified Pension Plan or
          the Qualified Defined Contribution Plan) to which the Company or an
          affiliate of the Company contributed.

(b) Adjustments.

     (1)  To the extent that a Participant's Retirement Benefit under a
          Qualified Pension Plan is recalculated as a result of an amendment to
          such Qualified Pension Plan in order to increase the amount of his
          Retirement Benefit, the Participant's Supplemental Pension Benefit
          shall also be recalculated in order to properly reflect such increase
          in determining payments of the Participant's Supplemental Pension
          Benefit made on or after the effective date of such increase.

                                       5
<PAGE>

     (2)  Any benefit payable pursuant to this Section 3.1 shall be adjusted in
          accordance with new limitations, if any, established by the Internal
          Revenue Service on payments that may be made from the Qualified
          Pension Plan.

(c) Distribution of Supplemental Pension Benefit.

     (1)  The Supplemental Pension Benefit, as determined in accordance with
          this Section 3.1, shall be payable in monthly increments as of the
          first day of the month concurrently with and in the same manner as the
          Participant's Retirement Benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan.
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant's Supplemental
          Pension Benefit, as calculated in the form of a life annuity, is less
          than $50 per month, then the present value of the Supplemental Pension
          Benefit may be paid in a lump sum or the Supplemental Pension Benefit
          may be paid in quarterly, semi-annual, or annual payments, as the
          Committee may designate.

     (2)  Pre-Retirement Survivor's Benefit. If a Participant dies while
          employed by the Employer and his Beneficiary is eligible for the
          pre-retirement survivor's benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan,
          his Beneficiary shall be entitled to receive a survivor's benefit from
          this Plan calculated in the same manner and payable at the same time
          as the pre-retirement survivor's benefit under the Qualified Pension
          Plan.

     (3)  Post-Retirement Survivor's Benefit. If a Participant dies after
          Supplemental Pension Benefit payments have begun, his Beneficiary
          shall be entitled to receive a survivor's benefit from this Plan
          calculated in the same manner and payable at the same time as the
          post-retirement survivor's benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan.

     (4)  Termination of Employment. Except as provided in Article IV of this
          Plan, if a Participant's employment with the Employer terminates for a
          reason other than death before his Earliest Retirement Date, no
          Supplemental Pension Benefit will be payable from this Plan.

3.2 Supplemental Thrift Benefit.

(a) Benefit.

     (1)  If a Participant elects to contribute to the Qualified Defined
          Contribution Plan of the Employer, he may be entitled to a
          Supplemental Thrift Benefit determined under this Section 3.2. An
          Account shall be established for the Participant by the Employer, as
          of his initial Plan Year of participation in this Plan. Each Plan
          Year, such Account shall be credited with hypothetical contributions
          equal to the amount that: i) the Employer is prohibited from
          contributing as a matching contribution under the Qualified Defined
          Contribution Plan on behalf of the

                                        6

<PAGE>

          Participant as a result of the limitations imposed by Code Sections
          401(a)(17), 401(k), 401(m), 402(g) and 415 or ii) the Employer is
          prohibited from contributing as a matching contribution under the
          Qualified Defined Contribution Plan on behalf of the Participant
          solely on account of the fact that deferred compensation is not
          considered eligible pay for purposes of the Qualified Defined
          Contribution Plan. If the Participant does not have a valid pre-tax or
          after-tax deferral election on file under the Qualified Defined
          Contribution Plan for a particular pay period, no amounts shall be
          credited to the Participant's Account with respect to such pay period.
          All amounts so credited to the Account of the Participant shall be
          deemed to be invested in the Company Stock fund at the same time and
          at the same share cost that such amounts would have been so invested
          if they had been contributed by the Employer to the Qualified Defined
          Contribution Plan. In addition, such Account shall be credited with
          such additional hypothetical shares as could be purchased with the
          dividends which would have been payable if the credited shares had
          been outstanding.

     (2)  In no event shall the sum of total matching contributions under the
          Qualified Defined Contribution Plan and hypothetical contributions
          under this Plan exceed three percent of the Participant's eligible
          compensation as defined for purposes of the Qualified Defined
          Contribution Plan, but without regard to compensation deferred under
          the Deferred Compensation Plan and the limits of Code Section
          401(a)(17).

(b) Distribution of Supplemental Thrift Benefit.

     (1)  Distribution of the total value of an Account of a Participant shall
          be received by the Participant when he is no longer an Employee in
          accordance with this Section 3.2(b)(1) or shall be received by the
          Beneficiary of a deceased Participant in accordance with Section
          3.2(b)(2). A Participant may elect to receive such a distribution upon
          his permanent and total disability as determined by the Committee
          (according to such elections as may be prescribed by the Committee).
          Distributions shall be made in the form of lump sum cash payments, or
          in such other form as the Committee may approve. Distribution of a
          Participant's Account shall be comprised of the cash value of the sum
          of the hypothetical shares of Company Stock, if any, credited to the
          Account in accordance with Section 3.2(a) plus the cash value of
          hypothetical contributions and dividends which have accrued since the
          most recent Valuation Date as defined in the Qualified Defined
          Contribution Plan. The value of the hypothetical shares of Company
          Stock shall be determined using the highest Market Price between the
          fifteenth day of the month of termination of the Participant and the
          first working day in the month following termination. Payment shall be
          made to the Participant or Beneficiary as soon as administratively
          feasible, but not later than one year, following the termination of
          the Participant's employment. If any benefits payable to, or on behalf
          of, a Participant are not claimed for a period of seven years from the
          date of entitlement as determined by the Committee, the value of the
          Account shall revert to the Company. In the event that a Participant
          resumes

                                       7
<PAGE>

          his employment prior to the distribution of the value of his
          Account, the distribution shall not be made, and no subsequent
          distribution shall be made until the reemployed Participant again
          ceases to be an Employee.

     (2)  Upon the death of a Participant, the total value of his Account as
          calculated in Section 3.2(a)(1) above shall be paid to his designated
          Beneficiary or Beneficiaries. If there is no surviving Beneficiary,
          the value will be disposed of as designated by the will of a
          Participant, or by the applicable intestate statute.

     (3)  The Committee in its sole discretion upon application made by the
          Participant, a designated Beneficiary, or their legal representative,
          may determine to extend or otherwise make payments in a manner
          different from manner provided above in the event of a Participant's
          death or total disability (as determined by the Social Security
          Administration).

3.3 Change in Control.

In the event of a Change in Control, while this provision remains in effect, no
amendment will thereafter be made to this Section for a period of at least two
consecutive years following the date when the Change in Control occurs. The
enhancement of benefits described in this Section is conditional upon this
Section remaining in effect until a Change in Control occurs, and is not part of
any Participant's accrued benefit as defined in the Qualified Pension Plan. If
any Participant's employment terminates for any reason whatsoever during the two
consecutive year period which begins on the date when a Change in Control
occurs, the change of control provisions in the Qualified Pension Plan will
apply.


                                   ARTICLE IV
                           VESTING AND FORFEITABILITY

4.1 Forfeitability of Supplemental Pension Benefit.

(a)  Except as provided in subsection (c) of this Section 4.1, all rights to the
     portion of the Supplemental Pension Benefit described in Section 3.1(a)(i)
     above shall be extinguished and forfeited if a Participant terminates
     employment with the Employer prior to his Earliest Retirement Date for any
     reason other than death, unless otherwise expressly provided in writing by
     the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.

(b)  All rights to the portion of the Supplemental Pension Benefit described in
     Section 3.1(a)(ii) above shall be extinguished and forfeited if a
     Participant terminates employment with the Employer prior to becoming
     vested in his Retirement Benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan. If a
     Participant is fully vested in his Retirement Benefit under the Qualified
     Pension Plan, he shall be fully vested in the portion of the Supplemental
     Pension Benefit described in Section 3.1(a)(ii), but the portion of the
     Supplemental Pension Benefit described in Section 3.1(a)(i) shall still be
     subject to the conditions described in Section 4.1(a).

                                       8

<PAGE>

(c) Participants on December 31, 1993.

     Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, each Employee who is
     a Participant in the Plan as of December 31, 1993 shall be deemed vested in
     the portion of his Supplemental Pension Benefit, if any, calculated as of
     December 31, 1993 (based on his compensation and years of benefit service
     as of such date and assuming that he is vested under the Qualified Pension
     Plan of the Employer), and such benefit under the Plan shall not be subject
     to forfeiture under Section 4.1(a). If the Participant terminates
     employment with the Employer before his Earliest Retirement Date, such
     vested benefit shall be payable in monthly increments on the first day of
     the month concurrently and in the same manner as the Participant's
     Retirement Benefit under the Qualified Pension Plan, or if no Retirement
     Benefit is payable from the Qualified Pension Plan, then in monthly
     increments commencing on the first day of the month following the
     Participant's Earliest Retirement Date. Such monthly benefit shall be
     reduced, using the same reduction factors as are in use under the Qualified
     Pension Plan for a vested terminated participant, for each month by which
     the Participant's first payment under this Plan precedes the first day of
     the month on or after the Participant attains age 65. If the Participant's
     Supplemental Pension Benefit is less than $50 per month, as calculated in
     the form of a life annuity, the present value of the Supplemental Pension
     Benefit may be paid in a lump sum or the Supplemental Pension Benefit may
     be paid in quarterly, semi-annual, or annual payments, as the Committee may
     designate.

4.2 Forfeitability of Supplemental Thrift Benefit.

The Supplemental Thrift Benefit shall become vested and nonforfeitable according
to the same terms as the Company matching contribution under the Qualified
Defined Contribution Plan. All rights to the Supplemental Thrift Benefit shall
be extinguished and forfeited to the extent the Participant's Company matching
contributions under the Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan are not vested at
the time the Participant terminates employment. If a Participant's Company
matching contributions under the Qualified Defined Contribution Plan are fully
vested, his Supplemental Thrift Benefit shall also be fully vested. If a
Participant's Company matching contributions under the Qualified Defined
Contribution Plan are non-vested or a percentage of such contributions are
vested, his Supplemental Thrift Benefit shall be considered vested in the same
proportion as the Company matching contributions are vested under the Qualified
Defined Contribution Plan.

4.3 Non-Competition.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any benefits under this Plan which a Participant
is receiving shall cease, and all rights under the Plan shall be extinguished,
if a Participant terminates employment with the Employer and without the
Employer's consent is subsequently (i) employed by or in any manner provides
services for any business organization that is in direct competition with the
Employer, or (ii) personally engages in direct competition with the Employer. If
a court of competent jurisdiction finds that the restrictions provided for in
(i) and (ii) are unenforceable,


                                       9
<PAGE>

then such benefits shall be forfeited if a Participant competes either as an
employee or directly in the widest geographical area and for the longest period
of time that are legally enforceable.


                                   ARTICLE V

provisions of this Plan, including questions of fact, which interpretations or
construction shall be final and binding on all parties, including but not
limited to the Company and any Participant or Beneficiary. The Committee shall
administer such terms and provisions in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner
and in full accordance with any and all laws applicable to the Plan.

5.5  Information.

To enable the Committee to perform its functions, the Company shall supply full
and timely information to the Committee on all matters relating to the
Compensation of all Participants, their death or other events which cause
termination of their participation in this Plan, and such other pertinent facts
as the Committee may require.

5.6  Compensation, Expenses and Indemnity.

(a)  The Committee is authorized at the expense of the Company to employ such
     legal counsel, actuaries, accountants and other advisers as it may deem
     advisable to assist in the performance of its duties hereunder. Expenses
     and fees in connection with the administration of the Plan shall be paid by
     the Company.

(b)  To the extent permitted by applicable state law, the Company shall
     indemnify and hold harmless the Committee and each member thereof, the
     Board of Directors and any

                                       11
<PAGE>

     delegate of the Committee who is an employee of the Company against any and
     all expenses, liabilities and claims, including legal fees to defend
     against such liabilities and claims arising out of their discharge in good
     faith of responsibilities under or incident to the Plan, other than
     expenses and liabilities arising out of willful misconduct. This indemnity
     shall not preclude such further indemnities as may be available under
     insurance purchased by the Company or provided by the Company under any
     bylaw, agreement or otherwise, as such indemnities are permitted under
     state law.

5.7  Statements.

Under procedures established by the Committee, a Participant shall receive a
statement with respect to such Participant's Supplemental Thrift Account on a
regular basis, not less frequently than annually.

5.8  Disputes.

(a)  Claim. A person who believes that he or she is being denied a benefit to
     which he or she is entitled under this Plan (hereinafter referred to as
     "Claimant") must file a written request for such benefit with the
     Committee, setting forth his or her claim within 90 days of the date such
     Claimant believes he or she was entitled to benefits under the Plan. The
     request must be addressed to the Committee at the Company's principal place
     of business.

(b)  Claim Decision. Upon receipt of a claim, the Committee (or its delegate,
     hereinafter collectively referred to as "Committee") shall advise the
     Claimant that a reply will be forthcoming within 90 days and shall, in
     fact, deliver such reply within such period. The Committee may, however,
     extend the reply period for an additional 90 days for special
     circumstances. If the claim is denied in whole or in part, the Committee
     shall inform the Claimant in writing, setting forth: (i) the specified
     reason or reasons for such denial; (ii) the specific reference to pertinent
     provisions of this Plan on which such denial is based; (iii) a description
     of any additional material or information necessary for the Claimant to
     perfect his or her claim and an explanation of why such material or such
     information is necessary; (iv) appropriate information as to the steps to
     be taken if the Claimant wishes to submit the claim for review; and (v) the
     time limits for requesting a review under subsection (c).

(c)  Request For Review. Within 60 days after the receipt by the Claimant of the
     written opinion described above, the Claimant may request in writing that
     the Committee review the determination of the Committee. Such request must
     be addressed to the Committee, at the Company's then principal place of
     business. The Claimant or his or her duly authorized representative may,
     but need not, review the pertinent documents and submit issues and comments
     in writing for consideration by the Committee. If the Claimant does not
     request a review within such 60-day period, he or she shall be barred and
     estopped from challenging the Committee's determination.

                                       12
<PAGE>

(d)  Review of Decision. Within 60 days after the Committee's receipt of a
     request for review, after considering all materials presented by the
     Claimant, the Committee will inform the Claimant in writing, the decision
     setting forth the specific reasons for the decision containing specific
     references to the pertinent provisions of this Plan on which the decision
     is based. If special circumstances require that the 60 day time period be
     extended, the Committee will so notify the Claimant and will render the
     decision as soon as possible, but no later than 120 days after receipt of
     the request for review.

(e)  Limitation of Actions. Any suit for benefits must be brought within twelve
     months after the date the Committee has made a final denial of the claim.
     Notwithstanding any other provision herein, any suit for benefits must be
     brought within two years after the date the claim for benefits first arose.


                                   ARTICLE VI
                                 MISCELLANEOUS

6.1  Unsecured General Creditor.

Participants and their Beneficiaries, heirs, successors, and assigns shall have
no legal or equitable rights, claims, or interest in any specific property or
assets of the Company. No assets of the Company shall be held in any way as
collateral security for the fulfilling of the obligations of the Company under
this Plan. Any and all of the Company's assets shall be, and remain, the general
unpledged, unrestricted assets of the Company. The Company's obligation under
the Plan shall be merely that of an unfunded and unsecured promise of the
Company to pay money in the future, and the rights of the Participants and
Beneficiaries shall be no greater than those of unsecured general creditors. It
is the intention of the Company that this Plan be unfunded for purposes of the
Code and for purposes of Title 1 of ERISA. Nothing contained in this Plan, and
no actions taken pursuant to the provisions of this Plan shall create or be
construed to create a trust or any kind of fiduciary relationship between the
Employer and any Participant, his Beneficiary, or any other person.

6.2  Restriction Against Assignment.

The Company shall pay all amounts payable hereunder only to the person or
persons designated by the Plan and not to any other person or corporation. No
part of a Participant's Account or benefit shall be liable for the debts,
contracts, or engagements of any Participant, his or her Beneficiary, or
successors in interest, nor shall a Participant's Account or benefit be subject
to execution by levy, attachment, or garnishment or by any other legal or
equitable proceeding, nor shall any such person have any right to alienate,
anticipate, sell, transfer, commute, pledge, encumber, or assign any benefits or
payments hereunder in any manner whatsoever. If any Participant, Beneficiary or
successor in interest is adjudicated bankrupt or purports to anticipate,
alienate, sell, transfer, commute, assign, pledge, encumber or charge any
distribution or payment from the Plan, voluntarily or involuntarily, the
Committee, in its discretion, may cancel such distribution or payment (or any
part thereof) to or for the benefit of such Participant, Beneficiary or
successor in interest in such manner as the Committee shall direct.

                                       13
<PAGE>


6.3  Tax Withholding.

There shall be deducted from each payment made under the Plan or any other
compensation payable to the Participant (or Beneficiary) all taxes which are
required to be withheld by the Company in respect to any payment under this
Plan. The Company shall have the right to reduce any payment (or compensation)
by the amount of cash sufficient to provide the amount of said taxes.

6.4  Amendment, Modification, Suspension or Termination.

(a)  The Committee may amend, modify, suspend or terminate the Plan in whole or
     in part, at any time, except that no amendment, modification, suspension or
     termination may retroactively adversely affect any Participant's right to a
     benefit which has vested under the Plan before such date.

(b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, with regard to
     any Participant who is subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act
     of 1934 or any Account of any such Participant, no amendment can be made to
     any Plan provision concerning the Supplemental Thrift Benefit relating to
     the amount and price of any Benefits hereunder the categories of
     Participants, the timing of any awards or the formula determining Benefits
     hereunder more than once every six months, except to comport with changes
     in the Code, in ERISA, or the rules thereunder.

6.5  Governing Law.

This Plan shall be construed, governed and administered in accordance with the
laws of the State of Georgia, to the extent not preempted by federal law,
without regard to the conflicts of law principles thereof.

6.6  Receipt or Release.

Any payment to a Participant or the Participant's Beneficiary in accordance with
the provisions of the Plan shall, to the extent thereof, be in full satisfaction
of all claims against the Committee and the Company. The Committee may require
such Participant or Beneficiary, as a condition precedent to such payment, to
execute a receipt and release to such effect.

6.7  Payments on Behalf of Persons Under Incapacity.

In the event that any amount becomes payable under the Plan to a person who, in
the sole judgment of the Committee, is considered by reason of physical or
mental condition to be unable to give a valid receipt therefore, the Committee
may direct that such payment be made to any person found by the Committee, in
its sole judgment, to have assumed the care of such person. Any payment made
pursuant to such determination shall constitute a full release and discharge of
the Committee and the Company.


                                       14
<PAGE>

6.8  Limitation of Rights and Employment Relationship.

Neither the establishment of the Plan nor any modification thereof, nor the
creating of any fund or Account, nor the payment of any benefits shall be
construed as giving to any Participant, or Beneficiary or other person any legal
or equitable right against the Company except as provided in the Plan; and in no
event shall the terms of employment of any Employee or Participant be modified
or in any way be affected by the provisions of the Plan.

6.9  Headings.

Headings and subheadings in this Plan are inserted for convenience of reference
only and are not to be considered in the construction of the provisions hereof.


The Coca-Cola Company Supplemental Benefit Plan is hereby amended and restated,

           of the Trustee throughout the Holding Period applicable to them; and

     when he has (or has within the preceding 12 months had) a Material Interest

                                       19
<PAGE>

6    ACQUISITION OF SHARES FOR THE PLAN

     Acquisition  of Shares:  The  Trustee,  upon the  direction of the Company,
     shall acquire Shares to be  Appropriated  as Free Shares or Matching Shares
     or to be  acquired  as  Partnership  Shares or  Dividend  Shares  either by
     acquiring  authorised  but  unissued  Shares or  treasury  Shares  from The
     Coca-Cola Company or by purchasing Shares on the market or otherwise.

7    RIGHTS ATTACHING TO PLAN SHARES

     Rights attaching to Plan Shares: Where the Trustee Appropriates or acquires
     Plan  Shares  a  proportion  of  which  rank  for  any  dividend  or  other
     distribution  or other rights  attaching to Shares by reference to a record
     date preceding the relevant  Appropriation  Day or  Acquisition  Date and a
     proportion  of  which do not,  then  the  Shares  to be  allocated  to each
     Qualifying  Employee  shall,  so  far  as  practicable,   be  in  the  same
     proportions of Shares with and without the rights.

8    RIGHTS ISSUES

8.1  Instructions to the Trustee:  Whenever any rights to be allotted any shares
     or  securities  (on  payment) or rights of any  description  are granted in
     respect of Plan Shares,  each Participant  shall be notified by the Trustee
     of the rights relating to his Plan Shares.  Each Participant may direct the
     Trustee and the Trustee may then, in accordance  with such  directions,  do
     one or more of the following:

       (a) subject to the provision by the  Participant of any necessary  funds,
           take up or sell  all or any of the  rights  or allow  them to  lapse;
           and/or

       (b) sell rights nil paid to the extent necessary to enable the Trustee to
           subscribe in full for the balance of any unsold rights.

     The Participant's directions may be of particular or general application
     and may relate to Plan Shares acquired before and after the date of the
     rights issue.

8.2  Period  for  giving  directions:  The  Trustee  shall  act  upon  any  such
     directions received by it not less than five Dealing Days before the expiry
     of the  period  allowed  for  the  exercise  of  any  such  rights.  If any
     Participant  has not by that time  given  directions  to the  Trustee  with
     regard to those rights and, if  appropriate,  provided any funds  necessary
     for the purpose,  the Trustee shall allow the rights to lapse.  Any Capital
     Receipt  received in consequence of the  non-exercise or sale of any rights
     shall be dealt with by the  Trustee in  accordance  with Clause 11.5 of the
     Deed.

                                       20
<PAGE>

8.3  New Shares:  Any shares,  securities  or rights  taken up by the Trustee on
     behalf of any Participant  under Rule 8.1(b) shall,  subject to Rule 13 and
     provided  that the right to so take up shares,  securities  or other rights
     was  conferred  in  respect  of all the  ordinary  shares in The  Coca-Cola
     Company,  form part of the Participant's Plan Shares and shall be deemed to
     have been  Appropriated  to or acquired on behalf of the Participant in the
     same way and at the same time as the  Participant's  Plan Shares in respect
     of which they are allotted.

8.4  Trustee's indemnity:  Nothing in this Rule shall require the Trustee to act
     in any manner which would involve it in any liability unless indemnified to
     its satisfaction by the Participant against such liability.

9    CAPITALISATION ISSUES

     Where any Shares are  allotted by way of  capitalisation  to the Trustee in
     respect of any Participant's  Plan Shares,  those Shares shall form part of
     that  Participant's Plan Shares and be deemed to have been Appropriated to,
     or acquired on behalf of, the  Participant  in the same way and at the same
     time as the  Participant's  Plan  Shares  in  respect  of  which  they  are
     allotted.

10   COMPANY RECONSTRUCTION

10.1 Company  Reconstruction:  This Rule  applies if there occurs in relation to
     any of a Participant's Plan Shares (the "Original Shares") a transaction:

       (a) which results in a new holding (the "New Holding") being equated with
           the Original Shares for the purposes of capital gains tax; or

       (b) which  would have that result but for the fact that what would be the
           new holding consists of or includes a Qualifying Corporate Bond.

       Such a transaction is referred to in the Plan as a Company
       Reconstruction.

10.2 Excluded Shares: If, as part of a Company Reconstruction, any:

       (a) redeemable  shares or  securities  issued  as  mentioned  in  section
           209(2)(a) of the Taxes Act;

       (b) share capital issued in circumstances such that section 210(l) of the
           Taxes Act applies; or

       (c) share capital to which section 249 of the Taxes Act applies,

     is/are  issued  and a charge to income  tax arises in respect of the issue,
     those  shares  shall not form part of the New Holding  for the  purposes of
     this Rule.

                                       21
<PAGE>

10.3 New Shares:  In this Rule "New Shares" means,  subject to Rule 10.2, shares
     comprised in the New Holding  which were issued in respect of, or otherwise
     represent, the Original Shares.

10.4 Effect on Original Shares: For the purposes of the Plan:

       (a) a Company Reconstruction shall be treated as not involving a disposal
           of the Original Shares;

       (b) the date on which any New Shares  are to be  treated  as having  been
           Appropriated to or acquired on behalf of a Participant  shall be that
           on which his Original Shares were so Appropriated or acquired;

       (c) the  conditions  in Part VIII  (types  of share  that may be used) of
           Schedule  8 shall be  treated as  fulfilled  with  respect to any New
           Shares if they were (or were  treated as)  fulfilled  with respect to
           the Original Shares; and

       (d) the provisions of Part X (income tax) and Part XI (capital gains tax)
           of Schedule 8 shall apply in relation to the New Shares as they would
           have applied to the Original Shares.

10.5 References to Plan Shares:  Following a Company Reconstruction,  references
     to a  Participant's  Plan Shares shall be  construed,  subject to the above
     provisions,  as being or, as the case may be, as  including,  references to
     any New Shares.

11   EVENTS DURING HOLDING PERIOD

11.1 Takeover:  A Participant  may during the Holding  Period of any of his Plan
     Shares direct the Trustee to:

       (a) accept an offer for those Plan Shares (the "Original Shares") if such
           acceptance  will  result  in a new  holding  being  equated  with the
           Original Shares for the purposes of capital gains tax;

       (b) accept an offer of a Qualifying Corporate Bond (whether alone or with
           other  assets  or cash or both) for  those  Plan  Shares if the offer
           forms part of a general offer as mentioned in Rule 11.1(c) below;

       (c) accept an offer of cash, with or without other assets, for those Plan
           Shares if the offer  forms part of a general  offer  which is made to
           holders of shares of the same  class as his  shares in The  Coca-Cola
           Company and which is made in the first  instance on a condition  such
           that if it is satisfied the person making the offer will have control
           of The  Coca-Cola  Company,  within the meaning of section 416 of the
           Taxes Act; or

                                       22
<PAGE>

       (d) agree to a transaction  affecting  those Plan Shares or those of them
           which are of a particular  class, if the transaction would be entered
           into pursuant to a compromise, arrangement or scheme applicable to or
           affecting:

          (i) all the ordinary  share capital of The  Coca-Cola  Company or, as
              the case may be, all the shares of the class in question; or

         (ii) all the shares, or all the shares of the class in question, which
              are held by a class of shareholders identified otherwise than by
              reference to their employment or their participation in an
              Employee Share Ownership Plan.

11.2 Compulsory acquisition:  In the event of any Plan Shares being compulsorily
     acquired  under  sections  428 to  430F  of the  Companies  Act  1985,  the
     Participants  concerned  shall be entitled to receive  notification of this
     from the  Trustee as soon as  practicable  after the  acquisition,  and the
     provisions of Rules 13 and 14 shall apply with the necessary changes so far
     as relevant.

12   FRACTIONAL ENTITLEMENTS

12.1 Proportionate  allocation:  Where the Trustee receives additional rights or
     securities  in respect of Plan  Shares  under a Company  Reconstruction,  a
     takeover or compulsory  acquisition  described in Rule 11, a capitalisation
     or rights issue or similar offer or invitation,  the Trustee shall allocate
     those  rights  or  securities  amongst  the  Participants  concerned  on  a
     proportionate  basis.  If that  allocation  gives rise to a  fraction  of a
     security or of a transferable unit of a security (in this Rule "unit"), the
     Trustee  shall  round  the  allocation  down to the  next  whole  unit  and
     aggregate  the  fractions  not  allocated.  The Trustee  shall use its best
     endeavours  to sell  any  rights  or  units  which  are not  allocated  and
     distribute the net proceeds of sale (after deducting from them any expenses
     of  sale  and any  taxation  which  may be  payable  in  respect  of  them)
     proportionately among the Participants whose allocations were rounded down,
     but so that any sum of less than 3 otherwise distributable to a particular
     Participant may be  retained  by the  Trustee and used for the  purposes of
     the Plan.

12.2 Allocation by reference to time of  Appropriation  or  acquisition:  In any
     circumstances in which the Trustee receives New Shares which form part of a
     Participant's Plan Shares, the Trustee shall allocate the New Shares to the
     Participant  by  reference  to  the  relative  times  of  Appropriation  or
     acquisition  of his Plan Shares to which they  relate.  If that  allocation
     gives  rise to a fraction  of a New  Share,  the  Trustee  shall  round the
     allocation  up or down to the next  whole  unit as it,  in its  discretion,
     thinks fit.

                                       23
<PAGE>

13   TRANSFER OF PLAN SHARES

     Subject  to  Clause  11.3  of the  Deed,  the  Trustee  shall,  as  soon as
     practicable  after it is  required  to do so under the Plan,  transfer  the
     legal title to any Plan Shares it holds on behalf of that  Participant into
     the name of the relevant Participant (or his nominee).

14   STAMP DUTY

     Any stamp duty or other expenses  involved in any transfer of Shares by the
     Trustee shall be payable:

       (a) in the case of a  transfer  into the  name of a  Participant,  by the
           Trustee (and reimbursed by the relevant Participating Company); and

       (b) in any other case, by the transferee.

15   NOTICES

15.1 Directions  to the  Trustee:  Any  direction  given to the Trustee by or on
     behalf of a Participant  or any person in whom the  beneficial  interest in
     his Plan Shares is for the time being  vested  under the Plan must be given
     in writing and, unless given electronically, signed by the relevant person.

15.2 Notices:  Any notice  which the  Trustee  gives to any  Eligible  Employee,
     Qualifying Employee or Participant shall be in writing (including by email)
     and  sufficiently  given if delivered to him  personally,  by email or sent
     first class  through the post  pre-paid,  in either case  addressed  to the
     Eligible  Employee,  Qualifying  Employee or Participant at the address (or
     email address) last known to the Trustee (including any address supplied by
     the  relevant  Participating  Company).  If the notice is sent by post,  it
     shall be deemed to have been duly  given on the day  following  the date of
     posting  and in the case of a notice  sent by email,  it shall be deemed to
     have been duly  given when sent  provided  the  Trustee  is not  thereafter
     notified that the email is undeliverable.

16   DISPUTES

     The  decision  of the  Company on any  dispute or  question  affecting  any
     Eligible Employee,  Qualifying Employee or Participant under the Plan shall
     be final and conclusive.

17   TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT

     The rights and obligations of an individual  under the terms and conditions
     of his office or employment  shall not be affected by his  participation in
     the Plan or any right he may have to participate in the Plan. An individual
     who  participates  in the Plan waives all and any rights to compensation or
     damages in consequence of the  termination of his office or employment with
     any  company  for any  reason  whatsoever  - whether  lawful or  unlawful -
     insofar  as those  rights  arise,  or may arise,  from his  ceasing to have
     rights  under or to be entitled to the Shares under the Plan as a result of
     such  termination or from the loss or diminution in value of such rights or
     entitlements.  If necessary,  the individual's terms of employment shall be
     varied accordingly.

                                   PART THREE

                                  FREE SHARES

1    INVITATION TO PARTICIPATE

     If the Company decides that an  Appropriation of Free Shares shall be made,
     it shall invite all Eligible  Employees who are not at that time a party to
     a Participation Contract, to participate by issuing to them a Participation
     Contract.  To consent to the  Appropriation  of Free  Shares,  an  Eligible
     Employee must return the Participation  Contract duly completed by the date
     specified in it. If the Company does not receive a  Participation  Contract
     from an Eligible  Employee by the specified  date,  that Eligible  Employee
     shall be deemed to have declined to  participate  in the Plan at that time.
     The Company  shall  specify  the  Holding  Period for the Free Shares to be
     Appropriated  on an  Appropriation  Date.  The Holding  Period for any Free
     Shares already Appropriated under the Plan cannot be changed.

2    MAXIMUM VALUE OF FREE SHARES APPROPRIATED

     The maximum aggregate Initial Market Value of the Free Shares  Appropriated
     to a  Qualifying  Employee  in an  Appropriation  Year shall not exceed the
     maximum amount permitted by paragraph 24 of Schedule 8 from time to time.

3    PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND TARGETS

3.1  Appropriation may be subject to performance  measures:  An Appropriation of
     Free  Shares may be made  subject to  performance  measures  and targets as
     provided for under this Rule 3.

3.2  Requirements  as to  performance  measures:  If any  Appropriation  of Free
     Shares under the Plan is to be made subject to  performance  measures  they
     must be:

       (a) provided for all persons who are  Qualifying  Employees in respect of
           that Appropriation;

       (b) based on business results or other objective criteria;

       (c) fair and objective  measures of the  performance  of the  Performance
           Units to which they apply;

       (d) set for Performance  Units where no employee is a member of more than
           one Performance Unit; and

       (e) be either Restricted Performance Measures or Unrestricted Performance
           Measures.


                                       26
<PAGE>

3.3  Restricted Performance Measures: If the Company decides to Appropriate Free
     Shares by reference to  Restricted  Performance  Measures,  at least 20 per
     cent. of the Free Shares to be Appropriated  must be  Appropriated  without
     reference to  performance  measures and shall be  Appropriated  on the same
     terms as required by Rule 1 of Part Two of these Rules.  The remaining Free
     Shares shall be Appropriated  subject to performance  measures but so that,
     in respect  of such  Appropriation,  the  highest  Appropriation  made to a
     Qualifying  Employee by reference to performance  measures shall be no more
     than four times the highest  Appropriation to a Qualifying Employee without
     reference to performance measures.  The Free Shares awarded by reference to
     performance measures need not be Appropriated on the same terms as required
     by Rule 1 of Part Two of these Rules.

3.4  Unrestricted  Performance  Measures:  If the Company decides to Appropriate
     Free Shares by reference to Unrestricted  Performance  Measures some or all
     of the Free  Shares  shall be  Appropriated  by  reference  to  performance
     measures but so that:

       (a) Appropriations of Free Shares to Qualifying Employees who are members
           of the same  Performance  Unit  shall  be made on the  same  terms as
           required by Rule 1 of Part Two of these Rules; and

       (b) Free Shares  Appropriated  for each Performance Unit shall be treated
           as separate Appropriations.

3.5  Company's  obligation to notify:  If an  Appropriation of Free Shares under
     the Plan is to be made  subject to  performance  measures  and  targets the
     Company  must,  as soon as  reasonably  practicable,  notify each  Eligible
     Employee:

       (a) of the  performance  measures  and  targets  which  will  be  used to
           determine  the  number  or  value,  as  appropriate,  of Free  Shares
           Appropriated to him; and

       (b) in general terms of the  performance  measures  which will be used to
           determine the number or value, as  appropriate,  of Free Shares to be
           Appropriated  to  each  Qualifying  Employee  participating  in  that
           Appropriation.

3.6  Confidential  information:  In fulfilling its obligations under Rule 3.5(b)
     above,  the Company shall not be obliged to disclose any information  which

4    BASIS OF APPROPRIATION

4.1  Free Shares - no performance  measures:  Free Shares to be  Appropriated to

     of any  Appropriation  of Free  Shares to be made  subject  to  performance

                                   PART FOUR

                     PARTNERSHIP SHARES AND MATCHING SHARES

1    INVITATIONS

1.1  Invitations to Eligible Employees:  If the Company decides to give Eligible
     Employees the  opportunity  to acquire  Partnership  Shares,  each Eligible
     Employee will be sent a Partnership Share Agreement under which:

       (a) the Eligible  Employee  would  authorise  the relevant  Participating
           Company to deduct part of his Salary for the purchase of  Partnership
           Shares; and

       (b) the  Company  would  agree to arrange  for  Partnership  Shares to be
           acquired on behalf of the Eligible  Employee in  accordance  with the
           Plan.

     To take the opportunity to acquire Partnership Shares, an Eligible Employee
     must return the  Partnership  Share  Agreement  duly  completed by the date
     specified  in it.  If the  Company  does not  receive a  Partnership  Share
     Agreement from an Eligible  Employee by the specified  date,  that Eligible
     Employee shall be deemed to have declined to acquire  Partnership Shares at
     that time.

1.2  Maximum  deductions  from Salary:  The  Partnership  Share  Agreement  must
     stipulate the maximum amount of  Partnership  Share Money (or percentage of
     Salary)  that may be deducted  from an Eligible  Employee's  Salary and the
     intervals at which such  deductions are to be made, but so that the maximum
     amount does not exceed the amount  permitted from time to time by paragraph
     36 of  Schedule 8 and does not,  in any event,  exceed 10 per cent.  of the
     Eligible Employee's Salary.

1.3  Percentage of Salary:  For the purposes of Rule 1.2 above, "10 per cent. of
     the Eligible Employee's Salary" shall mean:

       (a) if  the   Partnership   Share  Agreement  does  not  provide  for  an
           Accumulation  Period,  10 per cent. of the Salary  payment from which
           the deduction is made; and

       (b) if the  Partnership  Share  Agreement  provides  for an  Accumulation
           Period,  10 per cent. of the Salary  payments  over the  Accumulation
           Period.

1.4  Minimum  deductions from Salary: The Partnership Share Agreement in respect
     of any  invitation  may also  stipulate  that the  minimum  monthly  amount
     (irrespective  of  the  interval  for  deductions)  to be  deducted  from a
     Qualifying  Employee's  Salary in pursuance of that  Agreement  must not be
     less than a specified amount which must not be greater than [British
     Pounds] 10.

                                       29

<PAGE>

1.5  Prescribed notice: The Partnership Share Agreement must contain a notice in
     a prescribed  form in compliance with paragraph 38 of Schedule 8 (notice of
     possible effect of deductions on benefit entitlement).

2    PARTNERSHIP SHARE MONEY

     Any  Partnership  Share  Money  shall  be  paid to the  Trustee  as soon as
     practicable following its deduction from a Qualifying Employee's Salary and
     shall be held by the  Trustee  on his behalf  pending  its  application  in
     accordance  with Rule 3.1 or 4.3 of this Part Four, as  appropriate,  in an
     account (interest bearing or otherwise) with:

     (a) an institution authorised under the Banking Act 1987;

     (b) a building society; or

     (c) a relevant European institution.

     The Company  shall  determine and inform the Trustee of whether the account
     will be interest bearing.

     If the Partnership  Share Money held on behalf of a Qualifying  Employee is
     held in an interest  bearing  account,  the Trustee  shall  account for the
     interest to the Qualifying Employee.

3    NO ACCUMULATION PERIOD

3.1  Acquisition  of  Shares:  Any  Partnership  Share  Money  deducted  from  a
     Qualifying  Employee's  Salary under a Partnership  Share Agreement with no
     Accumulation Period will be applied by the Trustee in acquiring Partnership
     Shares on a date  (the  "Acquisition  Date")  set by the  Trustee  which is
     within 30 days after the deduction is made.  The number of Shares  acquired
     on behalf of a Qualifying  Employee shall be determined by reference to the
     Market Value of the Shares on the Acquisition Date.

3.2  Surplus  Partnership  Share  Money:  Any  surplus  Partnership  Share Money
     remaining after the  acquisition of Partnership  Shares by the Trustee may,
     with the agreement of the Qualifying Employee (which may be provided for in
     the Partnership Share Agreement),  be carried forward and added to the next
     deduction  of  Salary.  In any  other  case,  it must  be paid  over to the
     Qualifying  Employee  (subject  to  deduction  of income tax under PAYE and
     NICs, as appropriate) as soon as practicable.

                                       30

4    ACCUMULATION PERIOD

4.1  Accumulation Period: If the Company decides to offer an Accumulation Period
     in respect of an invitation to acquire  Partnership Shares, the Partnership
     Share Agreement must specify:

       (a) the length of the Accumulation  Period (which cannot exceed 12 months
           or, if different, any period specified from time to time in paragraph
           41(1) of Schedule 8);

       (b) when the Accumulation  Period starts (which may not be later than the
           date on which  the first  deduction  of  Salary  is made  under  that
           Agreement); and

       (c) when the Accumulation Period ends and whether the Accumulation Period
           will  come to an end  before  then  on the  occurrence  of  specified
           event(s).

4.2  Transaction  resulting in a new holding: If, during an Accumulation Period,
     a transaction occurs in relation to any Shares (the "original  holding") to
     be acquired  under a  Partnership  Share  Agreement  which results in a new
     holding of shares  (the "new  holding")  being  equated  with the  original
     holding for the purposes of capital gains tax and the  Qualifying  Employee
     so consents,  the  Partnership  Share Agreement shall have effect after the
     time of that  transaction  as if it were an  agreement  for the purchase of
     shares comprised in the new holding.

4.3  Acquisition  of Shares:  Subject to Rule 4.5, the  Partnership  Share Money
     deducted in respect of a Participant during an Accumulation  Period must be
     applied by the Trustee in  acquiring  Partnership  Shares on behalf of that
     Participant on a date (the "Acquisition  Date") set by the Trustee which is
     within 30 days  after the end of that  Accumulation  Period.  The number of
     Shares  acquired on behalf of a Qualifying  Employee  will be determined by
     reference to the lower of:

       (a) the Market Value of the Shares at the  beginning of the  Accumulation
           Period; and

       (b) the Market Value of the Shares on their Acquisition Date.

4.4  Surplus  Partnership  Share  Money:  Any  surplus  Partnership  Share Money
     remaining after the  acquisition of Partnership  Shares by the Trustee may,
     with the agreement of the Qualifying Employee (which may be provided for in
     the  Partnership  Share   Agreement),   be  carried  forward  to  the  next
     Accumulation  Period.  In any  other  case,  it must  be  paid  over to the
     Qualifying  Employee  (subject  to  deduction  of income tax under PAYE and
     NICs, as appropriate) as soon as practicable.

4.5  Repayment of Partnership  Share Money: In any case where  Partnership Share
     Money  has been  deducted  in an  Accumulation  Period  and the  Qualifying
     Employee  ceases to be in Employment  with a  Participating  Company during
     that  Accumulation  Period the  Partnership  Share  Money  deducted in that
     Accumulation  Period must be paid over to the Qualifying  Employee (subject
     to

                                       31
<PAGE>

     deduction of income tax under PAYE and NICs as appropriate) as soon as
     practicable.  The  Partnership  Share  Agreement  may provide that when the
     Accumulation Period comes to an end on the occurrence of an event specified
     in the Agreement the Partnership  Share Money deducted in that Accumulation
     Period must be paid over to the Qualifying  Employee  (subject to deduction
     of income tax under PAYE and NICs, as appropriate) as soon as practicable.

5    STOPPING AND RESTARTING DEDUCTIONS

5.1  Stopping  deductions:  A Qualifying Employee may at any time after entering
     into a Partnership  Share  Agreement give notice in writing to the relevant
     Participating  Company  to stop  deductions  from  his  Salary  under  that
     Agreement.

5.2  Restarting  deductions:  A Qualifying  Employee who has stopped  deductions
     from  his  Salary  in  pursuance  of  a  Partnership  Share  Agreement  may
     subsequently give notice in writing to the relevant  Participating  Company
     to restart deductions from his Salary under that Agreement. However:

     (a) any deductions that have been missed may not be made up; and

     (b) where the  deductions  are made during an  Accumulation  Period,  the
         Partnership  Share  Agreement may prevent a Qualifying  Employee from
         restarting deductions more than once in that Accumulation Period.

5.3  Termination  of  Partnership  Share  Agreement:  A Qualifying  Employee may
     terminate his  Partnership  Share Agreement at any time by giving notice in
     writing to the relevant  Participating Company. Where a Qualifying Employee
     terminates his Partnership Share Agreement,  no further deductions shall be
     made from his Salary  and any  Partnership  Share  Money held on his behalf
     shall be paid over to him  (subject to  deduction  of income tax under PAYE
     and NICs, as appropriate) as soon as practicable.

5.4  Effect of notice  under  Rules  5.1,  5.2 and 5.3:  Unless a later  date is
     specified  in any notice  given under Rule 5.1 or 5.3 above,  the  relevant
     Participating  Company must give effect to such a notice  within 30 days of
     receiving it. Unless a later date is specified in a notice given under Rule
     5.2 above, the relevant Participating Company must restart deductions under
     the  Partnership  Share  Agreement  no later  than  the  date of the  first
     deduction due under the Partnership Share Agreement more than 30 days after
     receipt of the notice.

6    WITHDRAWAL OF PARTNERSHIP SHARES

     A Participant may withdraw his Partnership Shares from the Plan at any
     time.

<PAGE>

7    NUMBER OF PARTNERSHIP SHARES THAT CAN BE ACQUIRED

7.1  Limit specified at time of invitation:  The Company may specify at the time
     of making an  invitation  under Rule 1 the  maximum  number of  Partnership
     Shares that can be acquired on behalf of Eligible  Employees  in respect of
     that  invitation.   The  Partnership   Share  Agreement  shall  contain  an
     undertaking  by the  Company  to notify  each  Qualifying  Employee  of any
     restriction on the number of Shares to be acquired:

     (a) if there is no  Accumulation  Period,  before  the  deduction  of any
         Partnership Share Money under the Partnership Share Agreement; or

     (b) if there is an  Accumulation  Period,  before  the  beginning  of the
         Accumulation Period under that Partnership Share Agreement.

7.2  Scaling down: If the Company receives  applications for Partnership  Shares
     in excess of the maximum number of Partnership  Shares specified in respect
     of that invitation  under Rule 7.1, then the following steps shall be taken
     in sequence until the excess number is eliminated:

     (a) the  excess  of the  monthly  deduction  chosen  by  each  Qualifying
         Employee over the amount  stipulated  under Rule 1.4 shall be reduced
         pro rata;

     (b) all  monthly  deductions  shall be reduced  to the amount  stipulated
         under Rule 1.4; and

     (c) Partnership  Share Agreements shall be selected by lot, each based on
         a monthly deduction of the amount stipulated under Rule 1.4.

7.3  Modification/withdrawal  and  notification:   If  Rule  7.2  applies,  each
     Partnership  Share  Agreement  shall be  deemed to have  been  modified  or
     withdrawn in accordance with Rule 7.2 and each Qualifying Employee shall be
     notified accordingly.

8    MATCHING SHARES

8.1  Matching Shares - acquisition and forfeiture:  If the Company  decides,  in
     conjunction  with an invitation  to acquire  Partnership  Shares,  to offer
     Matching Shares,  each Eligible  Employee shall be sent a Partnership Share
     Agreement.  The Partnership  Share Agreement will state the extent (if any)
     to which the Matching  Shares  appropriated  to a Participant in respect of
     the associated  Partnership  Shares will be forfeited if, other than in the
     event of Permitted Cessation, the Participant:

     (a) ceases to be in Employment;

     (b) withdraws the Matching Shares from the Plan; or

                                       33

<PAGE>

     (c) withdraws the associated Partnership Shares from the Plan,

     in each case within such period after the relevant Shares were Appropriated
     to him (not to exceed  three years) as is stated in the  Partnership  Share
     Agreement.

8.2  Terms of Matching Shares: Matching Shares shall:

     (a) be  Shares  of the  same  class  and  carry  the same  rights  as the
         Partnership Shares to which they relate;

     (b) be Appropriated  on the same day as the  Partnership  Shares to which
         they relate are acquired on behalf of the Qualifying Employee; and

     (c) in respect of any  Appropriation,  be  Appropriated to all Qualifying
         Employees on exactly the same basis.

8.3  Ratio of Matching  Shares to  Partnership  Shares:  The  Partnership  Share
     Agreement under which Matching Shares are offered must specify the ratio of
     Matching  Shares to  Partnership  Shares for the time being  offered by the
     Company and the  circumstances and manner in which the ratio may be changed
     by the  Company.  The  ratio  must  not  exceed  2:1 (or such  other  ratio
     permitted by  paragraph  51(2) of Schedule 8 from time to time) and must be
     applied by reference to the number of Shares. The Qualifying  Employee must
     be  informed by the  Company if the ratio  offered by the  Company  changes
     before  Partnership  Shares are  acquired on his behalf  under the relevant
     Partnership Share Agreement.

                                   PART FIVE

                         REINVESTMENT OF CASH DIVIDENDS



1    PERMITTED REINVESTMENT

1.1  Mandatory or voluntary reinvestment: At the time of operating Part Three or
     Part Four of these Rules,  the Company may decide  that,  subject to Rule 2
     below,  all cash dividends paid in respect of any Plan Shares  Appropriated
     or acquired on behalf of a Participant  as a consequence  of that operation
     must either:

     (a) be applied in acquiring Dividend Shares on behalf of the Participant;
         or

     (b) be  applied  in   acquiring   Dividend   Shares  on  behalf  only  of
         Participants who elect to reinvest those dividends.

     If the Company decides  to impose  or allow such a facility under the Plan,
     the provisions of this Part Five of these Rules shall apply.

1.2  Dividend Shares/Holding Period: Dividend Shares shall be shares of the same
     class and carry the same  rights as the  Shares to which the cash  dividend
     relates and may not be subject to forfeiture.

     During the Holding Period,  the Participant  shall be bound by the terms of
     his  Participation  Contract with the Company to permit any Dividend Shares
     acquired on his behalf to remain in the hands of the  Trustee and  (subject
     to Clause 8 of the Deed) not to assign,  charge or otherwise dispose of his
     beneficial interest in such Dividend Shares.

2    LIMIT ON DIVIDEND REINVESTED

2.1  Maximum amount reinvested:  The amount applied under the Plan and any other
     Employee  Share   Ownership  Plan  in  acquiring   Dividend  Shares  for  a
     Participant  shall  not  exceed  [British  Pounds]  1,500  in any  Year  of
     Assessment  (or such  other  amount as may be  permitted  from time to time
     under paragraph 54(1) of Schedule 8).

2.2  Surplus  cash  dividend:  If the amount of cash  dividend  received  by the
     Trustee  in  respect  of a  Participant's  Plan  Shares  exceeds  the limit
     specified in Rule 2.1 above for that Participant in any Year of Assessment,
     the excess of the cash  dividend  must be paid over to the  Participant  as
     soon as practicable.


                                       35
<PAGE>

3    ACQUISITION OF DIVIDEND SHARES

3.1  Time of  acquisition:  Subject to Rule 3.3,  the Trustee  must apply a cash
     dividend  paid in  respect  of Plan  Shares  that  is to be  reinvested  in
     acquiring  Dividend  Shares on a date (the  "Acquisition  Date") set by the
     Trustee  which is a date  within  30 days  after the date on which the cash
     dividend is received by it. The Trustee must,  in exercising  its powers in
     relation to the acquisition of Dividend Shares,  treat Participants  fairly
     and equally and may, for these purposes, use any unappropriated Shares that
     it holds.

3.2  Number of Dividend Shares acquired:  The number of Dividend Shares acquired
     on behalf of a  Participant  shall be  determined  in  accordance  with the
     Market Value of those Shares on their Acquisition Date.

3.3  Carry  forward of  uninvested  amounts:  Any cash  dividend  available  for
     reinvestment  that is not  reinvested  either  because  the  amount  of the
     dividend is insufficient to acquire a Dividend Share or because there is an
     amount remaining after acquiring one or more Dividend Shares on behalf of a
     Participant may be retained by the Trustee and carried forward and added to
     the amount of the next cash dividend to be reinvested for that Participant.
     However,  any such amount  retained by the Trustee must be paid over to the
     Participant as soon as practicable:

     (a) if or to the extent  that it is not  reinvested  within the period of
         three years beginning with the date on which the dividend was paid;

     (b) if  the  Participant   ceases  to  be  in  Employment  prior  to  its
         reinvestment; or

     (c) if a Plan Termination Notice is issued prior to its reinvestment.

     For the purposes of this Rule an amount of cash  dividend  carried  forward
     from an earlier  cash  dividend  shall be treated as  reinvested  before an
     amount derived from a later cash dividend.

5.04    Notice of Direction

        The  Participant's  investment  direction  shall be made in writing  and

        the Participant's  future  contributions at least one month prior to the

        Valuation  Date  on  which  the  transfer   occurs.   The  amount  of  a
        Participant's  Contribution  Account  that may be  transferred  shall be
        specified by a Participant in increments of 1% and shall be subject to a

14      GENERAL PROVISIONS


14.01   Rights of Participants

        Neither the establishment of the Plan, nor any modification thereof, nor
        the  creation  of any fund,  trust or  account,  nor the  payment of any
        benefits  shall  be  construed  as  giving  any  Participant  or  former
        Participant  or  Employee  of a  Participating  Employer  or any  person
        whomsoever,  any  legal  or  equitable  right  against  a  Participating
        Employer,  the  Company  or the  Trustee,  unless  such  right  shall be

        Employee at any time,  all of which  rights  shall remain as if the Plan
        had not been established.

<DESCRIPTION>SHARE PURCHASE PLAN - DENMARK, EFFECTIVE AS OF 1991
<TEXT>
                                                                   EXHIBIT 10.33

                          SHARE PURCHASE PLAN - DENMARK

The Share Purchase Plan - Denmark is not set forth in any formal document. The
following is a written description of the plan.

Overview of the Plan.
- --------------------

The plan enables employees to buy shares in The Coca-Cola Company, through
regular saving. For every share the employee buy (maximum 3% of base salary),
Coca-Cola Nordic Services (CCNS)/Coca-Cola Denmark (CCDK) will match.
Furthermore, according to Danish Tax Law, the received shares are free of income
tax and social security. The shares may not be withdrawn for 5 years.


Details of the Plan
- -------------------

The employee is eligible to participate in the plan if the employee is a
permanent employee and has completed 6 months of continuous service with The
Coca-Cola Company. The employee cannot participate if he/she is no longer
employed by CCNS/CCDK even if such employee is receiving severance payments.

The employee can decide to save 1%, 2% or 3% (maximum) of gross base salary.
This amount is deducted monthly from the net pay (after tax), and is shown as a
separate deduction on the payslip. CCNS/CCDK matches the employee contribution.

CCNS/CCDK holds the total sum of money and each quarter instructs Danske Invest
(Danske Bank) to buy on the New York Stock Exchange the maximum number of whole
shares possible using the money which CCNS/CCDK holds. Any balance remaining
(which is insufficient to buy a whole share that quarter) is rolled forward and
added in the next quarter to buy further shares.

CCNS/CCDK instructs Danske Bank to open a depository account (for the shares)
for each employee and an account (for any remaining balance) for each employee.
The employee receives dividends on all shares.

Danske Bank's fees for buying the shares are paid by CCNS/CCDK. The employee
pays the fees as and when the employee sells the shares.

Taxation
- --------

The plan is approved by the Tax Authorities and therefore the contribution from
the CCNS/CCDK is free of tax. The employee needs to hold the shares for 5 years,
and then the shares can either be sold or transferred to another account. Danske
Bank automatically notifies the employee when the shares are released.

Termination
- -----------

The participation in the plan ends when the employee ends his or her employment
with CCNS/CCDK. The shares in the depository account are owned by the employee.

The Company is contingently liable for guarantees of indebtedness owed by third

that the Company will be required to satisfy the guarantees.

      FINANCIAL REVIEW INCORPORATING MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
                     The Coca-Cola Company and Subsidiaries

OUR BUSINESS

The Coca-Cola Company is the largest  manufacturer,  distributor and marketer of
nonalcoholic  beverage  concentrates and syrups in the world.  When used in this
report,  the terms "Company," "we," "us" or "our" mean The Coca-Cola Company and
its divisions and subsidiaries.  Our Company manufactures  beverage concentrates
and syrups as well as some  finished  beverages,  which we sell to bottling  and
canning  operations,   distributors,  fountain  wholesalers  and  some  fountain
retailers.  We are also the largest producer of ready-to-drink  juices and juice
drinks in the world.  In  addition,  we have  ownership  interests  in  numerous
bottling and canning operations.

     Our Company  exists to benefit and refresh  everyone  who is touched by our
business.  We believe our success ultimately depends on our ability to build and
nurture  relationships with constituents  essential to our business:  consumers,
customers,  bottlers,  business  partners,  government  agencies,   communities,
employees  and  share  owners.  In order to serve  and  create  value  for these
constituents,  our  Company  executes a business  strategy  to drive  profitable
volume growth focused on the following strategic priorities:

(1)  accelerate carbonated soft-drink growth, led by Coca-Cola;

(2)  selectively  broaden  our  family of  beverage  brands to drive  profitable
     growth;

(3)  grow  system  profitability  and  capability  together  with  our  bottling
     partners;

(4)  serve  customers with  creativity and consistency to generate growth across
     all channels;

(5)  direct investments to highest-potential areas across markets;

(6)  drive efficiency and cost effectiveness everywhere.


Significant Growth Opportunities

The  following  table  illustrates  how we  view  various  markets  for our
Company's  products  and  reflects  information  as of and  for the  year  ended

(1) Includes selected  countries within each of the identified  markets and
is not intended to include all countries within the given markets.

</TABLE>

     Leading-edge markets generated 47 percent of the Company's unit case volume
in 2002.  Annual per capita  consumption  of our  Company's  beverages  in these
leading-edge markets is 250 or more servings.  However,  even in our highest per
capita consumption market,  Mexico, less than one-third of the population drinks
brand  Coca-Cola on a daily  basis.  Emerging  markets,  where annual per capita
consumption  is less  than 50  servings,  contributed  only  11  percent  of the
Company's  unit case  volume in 2002.  More than 4 billion  people live in these
emerging markets.

     In  emerging  and  developing  markets,  our  focus is on  availability  of
affordable  products for consumers and building brand  preference.  In developed
and leading-edge markets, our approach to consumers is more sophisticated. Along
with  ensuring our products are affordable and  building  brand  preference,  we
must activate points of purchase so that consumers have greater connections with
our brands.


                                                        2002 ANNUAL REPORT - 45

<PAGE>


      FINANCIAL REVIEW INCORPORATING MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
                     The Coca-Cola Company and Subsidiaries

   In all markets, we need a consistent approach to always:

- - provide quality products and superior customer service;

- - strive to manage our brand/price/package/channel  strategy to meet consumer
  needs in a way that maximizes value for our system and leverages the unique
  and unparalleled strengths of our bottlers and our system infrastructure.

     We believe significant growth potential exists for our family of brands.

Profitable Growth
- -----------------
To add value to our  Company,  our growth must be  profitable.  Carbonated  soft
drinks  have  attractive  historical  margins,  and we expect  these  attractive
margins  to  continue  in the  future.  As a result,  we  intend  to  accelerate
carbonated  soft-drink  growth, led by Coca-Cola.  Additionally,  our Company is
continuing to profitably  broaden our family of brands.  In  particular,  we are
expanding and growing our  noncarbonated  offerings to provide more alternatives
to consumers. We plan to introduce and/or expand both carbonated soft drinks and
noncarbonated beverages as profitable introduction and/or expansion is warranted
in identified markets.  Increasing consumption of our entire family of beverages
on more occasions is a key success factor in all markets.

System Economics
- ----------------
For our Company to be successful, the bottler system must be successful. Bottler
returns  have been  improving,  and  equity  income  from our  bottlers  is also
steadily  improving.  The following are examples of joint  initiatives  to drive
profitability:

- - We  established  a  process  for top  management  level  meetings  with our
  bottling partners.

- - We  established  a bottler  Information  Technology  Advisory  Board  whose
  mission is to  prioritize,  recommend  and enable  execution of the highest
  impact system-wide information technology initiatives.

- - In North  America,  we  supported  our  bottlers as they  formed  Coca-Cola
  Bottlers'  Sales & Services  Company to  generate  significant  system-wide
  savings  in  procurement,   route  to  market   optimization   and  account
  management.

Corporate Governance
- --------------------
Corporate  governance  received  significant  attention in 2002. While strategic
priorities  and execution are critical to our business,  we have always been and
will continue to be committed to the highest standards of corporate  governance.
The following two examples demonstrate our commitment.

     First,  in July 2002, our Company  announced that we would expense the cost
of all forms of stock-based compensation, including stock options granted by the
Company.  We concluded  that stock  options are a form of employee  compensation
expense,  and it would  therefore be  appropriate  to reflect these costs in our
financial results.  Voluntarily changing to this preferable method of accounting
for employee stock options and other forms of stock-based  compensation  ensures
that our earnings more clearly reflect  economic  reality when all  compensation
costs  are  recorded  in  the  financial   statements.   Refer  to  the  heading
"Application of Critical  Accounting  Policies-Stock-Based  Compensation" and to
Notes 1 and 13.  (Throughout  this report,  references  to "Notes"  refer to the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included as part of this report.)

     Second,  in  December  2002,  our Company  changed our policy of  providing
future earnings guidance. Our Company will no longer provide quarterly or annual
earnings  per  share  guidance.  We will  continue  to  provide  investors  with
perspective on our value drivers,  our strategic  initiatives  and those factors
critical to understanding our business and operating  environment.  Our Company,
with  the  support  of the  Board  of  Directors,  concluded  that  establishing
short-term guidance can impede a more meaningful investor focus on the strategic
initiatives  that companies are taking to build  businesses and succeed over the
long run.

     Our  Company's  Board of  Directors  is  composed  of  qualified  directors
providing  appropriate  oversight.  Various committees of our Board of Directors
review and approve Company  transactions,  as  appropriate.  Our Audit Committee
members  are all  independent  directors.  Furthermore,  we defined  new guiding
principles  for how our  suppliers  conduct  business  and  reaffirmed a code of
ethics for our own employees and directors.

INVESTMENTS

With a business  system that  operates  locally in more than 200  countries  and
generates superior cash flows, we consider our Company to be uniquely positioned
to  capitalize  on  profitable  investment   opportunities.   Our  criteria  for
investment are simple:  New  investments  should  directly  enhance our existing
operations  and  generally  be expected to provide  cash returns that exceed our
long-term,  after-tax,  weighted-average  cost of capital  (calculated on a book
basis), currently estimated at between 8 and 10 percent.

     Because the beverage business has consistently  generated high returns,  we
consider it to be a particularly  attractive investment for us. Our expenditures
in developed and leading-edge markets focus primarily on marketing our Company's
brands.  In emerging and  developing  markets,  our objective is to increase the
penetration  of  our  products.  In  these  markets,  we  allocate  most  of our
investments  to  enhancing  our brands  and  infrastructure  such as  production
facilities, distribution networks, sales equipment and technology. We make these
investments by forming strategic  business  alliances with local bottlers and by
matching local expertise with our experience, resources and strategy.

     We pursue our strategic investment  priorities in a way that capitalizes on
the combination of our most fundamental and enduring  attributes-our brands, our
people and our bottling  partners.  The more than 6 billion  people in the world
represent  current and  potential  consumers of our  Company's  products.  As we
increase and meet consumer  demand for our family of brands,  we produce  growth
throughout the Coca-Cola system.

Our Brands
- ----------

Our offerings in the nonalcoholic beverages business include some of the world's
most  valuable  brands -- more than 300 in all.  These include  carbonated  soft
drinks  and  noncarbonated  beverages  such as juices and juice  drinks,  sports
drinks, water products, teas and coffees. Ultimately, consumer demand determines
the Company's optimal brand offerings.  To meet our long-term growth objectives,
we make  significant  expenditures to support our brands.  This process involves
investments to support existing  brands,  to develop new global or local brands,
and to acquire global or local brands when appropriate.

     In 2002,  our  Company  introduced  a variety of new  brands  and  products
including  Vanilla Coke and diet Vanilla Coke. Our existing  brands such as diet
Coke with lemon,  Fanta, Qoo and POWERade were introduced into new markets.  Our
Company  acquired brands during 2002 such as Risco water in Mexico,  Dorna water
and Valser water in Europe, and Rio Beverages in New Zealand.  Along with Danone
Waters of North  America,  Inc., we  established a joint  venture,  of which our
Company owns 51 percent, with the rights to the Dannon,  Sparkletts and Alhambra
brands in the United  States.  Our Company  acquired  long-term  global  license
rights for  Seagram's  nonalcoholic  carbonated  soft drinks and certain  assets
related  to the  Seagram's  mixer  business.  We entered  into a master  license
agreement for the Evian water brand in the United States and Canada. Also during
2002, our Company  continued our  collaboration  with The Walt Disney Company to
market noncarbonated children's beverages.

     We make  significant  investments  in  marketing  to  support  our  brands.
Marketing   investments   enhance  consumer   awareness  and  increase  consumer
preference for our brands.  This produces long-term growth in profitable volume,
per capita consumption and our share of worldwide nonalcoholic beverage sales.

Our People
- ----------
Our people -- the 56,000  employees  of our Company  who work with our  bottling
partners and other key constituents -- are essential to our success. To meet our
long-term  growth  objectives,  we  recruit  and  actively  cultivate  a diverse
workforce and establish a culture that fosters  learning,  innovation  and value
creation  on a daily  basis.  This means  maintaining  and  refining a corporate
culture that encourages our people to develop to their fullest potential,  which
enhances  enjoyment and  satisfaction  in the Company's  work  environment.  Our
Company values the uniqueness of all employees and the contributions  they make.
We put the  responsibility  and  accountability for ensuring local relevance and
maximizing  business  performance  in the hands of those  closest to the market.
Additionally,  we  have  made  innovation  an  explicit  priority  for  all  our
associates.  Our associates  work together with bottling  partners to understand
markets and what consumers want.  Then we meet that need by delivering  products
through our unparalleled system.

     The increase in the number of employees from 38,000 as of December 31, 2001
to 56,000 as of December 31, 2002 is primarily due to 2002  acquisitions.  For a
description of these acquisitions, refer to Note 18.

Our Bottling Partners
- ---------------------
The  financial  health  and  success  of  our  bottling  partners  are  critical
components of the Company's  ability to deliver leading brands.  Our people work
with our  bottling  partners  to  continuously  look for ways to improve  system
economics. Our Company has business relationships with three types of bottlers:

(1)  independently owned bottlers, in which we have no ownership interest;

(2)  bottlers in which we have invested and have a noncontrolling ownership
     interest;

(3)  bottlers  in which we have  invested  and have a  controlling  ownership
     interest.

     During  2002,   independently   owned  bottling   operations  produced  and
distributed approximately 23 percent of our worldwide unit case volume. Bottlers
in which we own a  noncontrolling  ownership  interest  produced and distributed
approximately  59 percent of our worldwide unit case volume in 2002.  Controlled
bottling operations accounted for 8 percent of 2002 volume.  Fountain operations
and The Minute Maid Company produced and distributed approximately 10 percent of
2002 volume.

     The  independently  owned bottling  operations and the bottlers in which we
have a noncontrolling  interest generally have significant funding from majority
owners and other financing sources that are otherwise unrelated to our Company.

     Bottlers in which we have a noncontrolling ownership interest are accounted
for under the cost or equity  method,  as  appropriate.  Equity  income or loss,
included  in our  consolidated  net  income,  represents  our  share  of the net
earnings or losses of our equity method investees.  In 2002, our Company's share
of income from equity method investments totaled $384 million.

     In July 2001, our Company and San Miguel  Corporation (San Miguel) acquired
Coca-Cola  Bottlers  Philippines,  Inc.  (CCBPI) from  Coca-Cola  Amatil Limited
(Coca-Cola  Amatil).  Upon completion of this transaction,  our Company owned 35
percent of the common shares and 100 percent of the Preferred B shares,  and San
Miguel owned 65 percent of the common shares of CCBPI. Additionally, as a result
of this transaction, our Company's interest in Coca-Cola Amatil was reduced from
approximately 38 percent to approximately 35 percent.

     During 2000,  the Company  entered into a joint venture in China with China
National Oils and Foodstuffs Imports/Exports  Corporation (COFCO), completion of
which  occurred in 2001.  COFCO  contributed  to the joint  venture its minority
equity  interests in 11 Chinese  bottlers.  Our Company  contributed  its equity
interests in two Chinese  bottlers plus cash in exchange for a 35 percent equity
interest in the venture.

     On  December  31,  1999,  we owned  approximately  51 percent of  Coca-Cola
Beverages  plc  (Coca-Cola  Beverages).  In July  2000,  a merger  of  Coca-Cola
Beverages and Hellenic  Bottling  Company S.A. was completed to create Coca-Cola
Hellenic  Bottling Company S.A.  (CCHBC).  This merger resulted in a decrease of
our  Company's  equity  ownership  interest  from  approximately  51  percent of
Coca-Cola  Beverages to approximately 24 percent of the combined entity,  CCHBC.
This change in  ownership  resulted in the Company  recognizing  a $118  million
tax-free, noncash gain in the third quarter of 2000.

     The following table presents the difference between calculated fair values,
based on quoted  closing  prices of publicly  traded  shares,  and our Company's
carrying  values for  significant  publicly  traded equity method  investees (in
millions):

compensate  for  limited  local  resources  and has enabled us to help focus the
bottler's  sales and marketing  programs,  assist in developing its business and
information systems and establish appropriate long-term capital structures.

     Effective   February  2002,  our  Company  acquired  control  of  Coca-Cola
Erfrischungsgetraenke   AG  (CCEAG),  the  largest  bottler  in  Germany.   This
transaction  was  accounted  for as a business  combination,  and the results of
CCEAG's  operations  have been  included in the Company's  financial  statements
since  February  2002.  Prior to February  2002,  CCEAG was accounted for by our
Company  under the equity  method of  accounting.  As of December 31, 2002,  our
Company had an  approximate  41 percent  ownership  interest in the  outstanding
shares of CCEAG.  In accordance  with the terms of a Control and Profit and Loss
Transfer Agreement (CPL) with CCEAG, our Company obtained control of CCEAG for a
period of up to five  years.  In return for the  control of CCEAG,  the  Company
guaranteed  annual  payments,  in lieu of dividends by CCEAG, to all other CCEAG
share owners.  Additionally,  all other CCEAG share owners entered into either a
put or put/call option agreement with the Company, exercisable at the end of the
term of the CPL at  agreed  prices.  Our  Company  entered  into  either  put or
put/call  agreements for shares  representing an approximate 59 percent interest
in CCEAG.

     In January  2002,  our  Company  and CCBPI  finalized  the  purchase of RFM
Corp.'s (RFM)  approximate 83 percent  interest in Cosmos  Bottling  Corporation
(CBC), a publicly  traded  Philippine  beverage  company.  The original sale and
purchase agreement with RFM was entered into in November 2001. As of the date of
this sale and purchase  agreement,  the Company began supplying  concentrate for
this operation. In March 2002, a tender offer was completed with our Company and
CCBPI  acquiring  all shares of the remaining  minority  share owners except for
shares  representing  a 1 percent  interest in CBC. As of December 31, 2002, our
Company's direct ownership interest in CBC was approximately 61 percent, and our
indirect  ownership   interest  in  CBC  was  approximately  13  percent.   This
transaction  was  accounted  for as a business  combination,  and the results of
CBC's operations have been included in the Company's financial  statements since
January  2002.  CBC is an  established  carbonated  soft-drink  business  in the
Philippines.  Our Company's goal is to leverage our partnership  with San Miguel
in the  Philippines,  as  well as  leverage  our  sales,  marketing  and  system
resources, to expand CBC volume and profit over time. The Company and CCBPI have
agreed to restructure the operations of CBC, and this  restructuring will result
in the Company  owning all  acquired  trademarks  and CCBPI  owning all acquired
bottling  assets.  Upon expected  completion of the  restructuring  in 2003, our
Company does not expect a significant gain or loss.

     In  February  2001,  our  Company  reached  agreement  with  Carlsberg  A/S
(Carlsberg)  for the  dissolution of Coca-Cola  Nordic  Beverages A/S (CCNB),  a
joint venture in which our Company had a 49 percent ownership interest.  At that
time,  CCNB had bottling  operations  in Sweden,  Norway,  Denmark,  Finland and
Iceland. Under this agreement with Carlsberg, our Company acquired CCNB's Sweden
and Norway bottling operations in June 2001,  increasing our Company's ownership
in those bottlers to 100 percent.  Carlsberg acquired CCNB's Denmark and Finland
bottling operations,  increasing  Carlsberg's ownership in those bottlers to 100
percent. Pursuant to the agreement, CCNB sold its Iceland bottling operations to
a third-party group of investors in May 2001.

     During  the first  half of 2001,  in  separate  transactions,  our  Company
purchased two bottlers in Brazil: Refrescos Guararapes Ltda. and Sucovalle Sucos
e Concentrados  do Vale S.A. In separate  transactions  during the first half of
2000, our Company  purchased two other bottlers in Brazil:  Companhia Mineira de
Refrescos,  S.A.  and  Refrigerantes  Minas Gerais Ltda.  In October  2000,  the
Company purchased a 58 percent interest in Paraguay Refrescos S.A.  (Paresa),  a
bottler in Paraguay.  In December  2000, the Company made a tender offer for the
remaining 42 percent of the shares in Paresa.  In January  2001,  following  the
completion of the tender offer, we owned approximately 95 percent of Paresa.

     In line with our long-term bottling strategy,  we consider alternatives for
reducing  our  ownership  interests  in  bottlers  in which we have  controlling
ownership  interests.  One alternative is to combine our bottling interests with
the bottling interests of others to form strategic business  alliances.  Another
alternative is to sell our interest in a bottling operation to one of our equity
investee  bottlers.  In both of these situations,  we continue to participate in
the bottler's  results of operations  through our share of the equity investee's
earnings or losses.

     In the  first  quarter  of 2002,  our  Company  sold our  Baltics  bottling
operations to CCHBC. The proceeds from the sale

of the Baltics  bottlers were  approximately  equal to the carrying value of the
investment.

     In November 2001, our Company sold nearly all of its ownership interests in
various Russian bottling  operations to CCHBC for approximately  $170 million in
cash and notes  receivable,  of which $146 million in notes receivable  remained
outstanding  as of December 31, 2001.  This amount was fully  collected in 2002.
These interests  consisted of the Company's 40 percent  ownership  interest in a
joint venture with CCHBC that operated bottling territories in Siberia and parts
of western Russia,  together with our Company's nearly 100 percent  interests in
bottling operations with territories covering the remainder of Russia.

     Refer  to  Notes  2 and 18 for  further  discussion  of the  above  bottler
transactions.


FINANCIAL STRATEGIES

The  following  strategies  are  intended  to  optimize  our  cost  of  capital,
increasing our ability to maximize share-owner value.

Debt Financing
- --------------
Our Company  maintains  debt levels we consider  prudent based on our cash flow,
interest  coverage and  percentage of debt to capital.  We use debt financing to
lower our overall cost of capital,  which increases our return on  share-owners'
equity.

     As of December 31, 2002,  our  long-term  debt was rated "A+" by Standard &
Poor's and "Aa3" by Moody's,  and our  commercial  paper program was rated "A-1"
and "P-1" by  Standard & Poor's and  Moody's,  respectively.  In  assessing  our
credit  strength,  both  Standard  & Poor's and  Moody's  consider  our  capital
structure and financial  policies as well as aggregated  balance sheet and other
financial  information for the Company and certain bottlers including  Coca-Cola
Enterprises Inc.  (Coca-Cola  Enterprises)  and CCHBC.  While the Company has no
legal obligation for the debt of these bottlers, the rating agencies believe the
strategic  importance of the bottlers to the Company's  business  model provides
the Company  with an  incentive  to keep these  bottlers  viable.  If our credit
ratings  were  reduced  by the  rating  agencies,  our  interest  expense  could
increase. Additionally, if certain bottlers' credit ratings were to decline, the
Company's  share of equity  income could be reduced as a result of the potential
increase in interest expense for these bottlers.

     The interest  coverage  ratio is a key item  monitored by rating  agencies.
Generally,  this ratio is computed as income  before  taxes  (excluding  unusual
items)  plus  interest  expense,  divided  by the sum of  interest  expense  and
capitalized interest. In accordance with this definition, our Company's interest
coverage ratio on a stand-alone  basis was 29x, 20x and 12x,  respectively,  for
the years ended  December 31,  2002,  2001 and 2000.  If the unusual  items were
included in the  calculation,  the interest  coverage ratio would have been 28x,
20x and 8x, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000.

     The interest  coverage  ratio is monitored by our Company for trends and is
one measurement  generally used by rating agencies in assessing debt ratings for
companies.  However, as described above, the rating agencies aggregate financial
data for certain  bottlers with our Company when  assessing our debt rating.  As
such,  the key measure is the aggregate  interest  coverage ratio of the Company
and  these  bottlers.  Both  Standard  & Poor's  and  Moody's  employ  different
aggregation  methodologies  and  have  different  thresholds  for the  aggregate
interest coverage ratio. These thresholds are not necessarily  permanent nor are
they fully disclosed to our Company.

     Our global presence and strong capital  position give us easy access to key
financial  markets  around  the  world,  enabling  us to raise  funds with a low
effective cost. This posture,  coupled with active  management of our percentage
mix of  short-term  and  long-term  debt,  results  in a lower  overall  cost of
borrowing.   Our  debt  management  policies,  in  conjunction  with  our  share
repurchase programs and investment  activity,  can result in current liabilities
exceeding current assets.

     In  managing  our use of debt,  we also  monitor  the  following  financial
measurements and ratios:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECEMBER 31,                              2002           2001            2000

================================================================================

     Our Company monitors the financial  measurements and ratios discussed above
in conjunction with our percentage mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate  debt and
other business and financial risks. The above financial measurements and

                     The Coca-Cola Company and Subsidiaries

ratios trended positively in 2002 and 2001, reflecting improved business results
and effective capital  management  strategies.  Additionally,  the 2000 ratio of
earnings to fixed charges was negatively  impacted by items  discussed under the
heading "Other Operating Charges."

Share  Repurchases
- ------------------
In October 1996, our Board of Directors  authorized a plan to
repurchase up to 206 million shares of our Company's  common stock through 2006.
In 2002 and 2001, we repurchased  approximately  14 million shares at an average
price  of  $48.42  and  5  million   shares  at  an  average  price  of  $48.53,
respectively, under the 1996 plan.

     In 2000, we did not repurchase any shares under the 1996 plan. This was due
to our utilization of cash for an organizational  realignment (the Realignment),
as discussed under the heading "Other Operating Charges," and the impact on cash
from the  reduction in  concentrate  inventory  levels by certain  bottlers,  as
discussed  under the headings  "Net  Operating  Revenues  and Gross  Profit" and
"Operating Income and Operating Margin."

     Since the inception of our initial share repurchase program in 1984 through
our current  program as of December  31,  2002,  we have  purchased  more than 1
billion shares of our Company's common stock.  This represents 32 percent of the
shares  outstanding  as of  January  1,  1984 at an  average  price per share of
$13.13.

     Our Company expects to make share repurchases of approximately $1.5 billion
in 2003.  As cash flows are  expected  to  increase  in  subsequent  years,  our
subsequent share repurchases are also expected to increase.

Dividend Policy
- ---------------
At its  February  2003  meeting,  our Board of  Directors  again  increased  our
quarterly  dividend,  raising it to $.22 per share,  equivalent  to a  full-year
dividend  of $.88  per  share  in  2003.  This is our  41st  consecutive  annual
increase.  Our annual common stock  dividend was $.80 per share,  $.72 per share
and $.68 per share in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

     In 2002, our dividend payout ratio was  approximately 65 percent of our net
income. To free up additional cash for reinvestment in our high-return  beverage
business, our Board of Directors intends to gradually reduce our dividend payout
ratio over time.


FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

Our  Company  uses  derivative  financial  instruments  primarily  to reduce our
exposure to adverse  fluctuations  in interest rates and foreign  exchange rates
and, to a lesser  extent,  adverse  fluctuations  in commodity  prices and other
market risks. We do not enter into derivative financial  instruments for trading
purposes. As a matter of policy, all our derivative positions are used to reduce
risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure. Because of the high correlation
between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure,  fluctuations in the
value of the instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value
of  the   underlying   exposure.   Virtually   all  of   our   derivatives   are
straightforward, over-the-counter instruments with liquid markets.

Foreign Currency
- ----------------
We manage most of our foreign currency exposures on a consolidated  basis, which
allows us to net certain  exposures and take  advantage of any natural  offsets.
With  approximately 77 percent of 2002 Operating  Income,  excluding  Corporate,
generated  outside the United  States,  weakness in one  particular  currency is
often  offset by  strengths  in others over time.  We use  derivative  financial
instruments to further reduce our net exposure to currency fluctuations.

     Our  Company  enters  into  forward  exchange  contracts  and  collars  and
purchases currency options  (principally euro and Japanese yen) to hedge certain
portions  of  forecasted   cash  flows   denominated   in  foreign   currencies.
Additionally,  the Company enters into forward exchange  contracts to offset the
earnings  impact  relating to exchange  rate  fluctuations  on certain  monetary
assets and liabilities.  The Company also enters into forward exchange contracts
as hedges of net investments in international operations.


                                                         2002 ANNUAL REPORT - 51

Interest Rates
- --------------
Our Company monitors our percentage mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, as
well as our  percentage mix of term debt versus  nonterm debt.  This  monitoring
includes a review of business and other  financial risks as noted above. We also
enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage these risks.

Value at Risk
- -------------
Our Company  monitors  our  exposure to  financial  market  risks using  several
objective measurement systems, including value-at-risk models. Our value-at-risk
calculations  use a historical  simulation  model to estimate  potential  future
losses in the fair value of our derivatives and other financial instruments that
could occur as a result of adverse  movements  in foreign  currency and interest
rates.  We have not  considered the potential  impact of favorable  movements in
foreign currency and interest rates on our calculations.  We examined historical
weekly  returns over the previous 10 years to calculate  our value at risk.  The
average value at risk  represents the simple  average of quarterly  amounts over
the past year. As a result of our foreign currency  value-at-risk  calculations,
we  estimate  with 95 percent  confidence  that the fair  values of our  foreign
currency  derivatives and other financial  instruments,  over a one-week period,
would  decline  by  less  than  $34  million,   $43  million  and  $37  million,
respectively,  using 2002, 2001 or 2000 average fair values and by less than $31
million and $37  million,  respectively,  using  December 31, 2002 and 2001 fair
values. According to our interest rate value-at-risk  calculations,  we estimate
with 95 percent  confidence that any increase in our net interest expense due to
an adverse move in our 2002 average or in our December 31, 2002  interest  rates
over a  one-week  period  would  not have a  material  impact  on our  financial
statements.  Our December 31, 2001 and 2000  estimates also were not material to
our financial statements.

                      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

VOLUME

We  measure  our sales  volume in two ways:  (1)  gallons  and (2) unit cases of
finished  products.  "Gallons"  represent  our primary  business and measure the
volume of concentrates,  syrups,  beverage bases, finished beverages and powders
(in all cases,  expressed  in  equivalent  gallons  of syrup)  for all  beverage
products  which are  reportable  as unit case  volume.  Most of our revenues are
based on this measure of primarily wholesale activity,  which consists mainly of
our sales to bottlers and customers.

     We  also  measure  volume  in  unit  cases.  "Unit  case"  means  a unit of
measurement  equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce
servings).  "Unit  case  volume"  means the  number of unit  cases (or unit case
equivalents)  of Company  trademark or licensed  beverage  products  directly or
indirectly sold by the Coca-Cola system to customers.  Volume primarily consists
of beverage  products  bearing Company  trademarks.  Also included in volume are
certain products licensed to our Company or owned by our bottling partners,  for
which our Company provides  marketing support and derives profit from the sales.
Such products  licensed to our Company or owned by our bottling partners account
for a minimal portion of total unit case volume.  Although most of our Company's
revenue is not based  directly on unit case volume,  we believe unit case volume
is one of the  measures  of the  underlying  strength of the  Coca-Cola  system
because it measures trends at the consumer level.

     Our worldwide  unit case volume  increased 5 percent in 2002, on top of a 4
percent increase in 2001. The increase reflects  acquisitions (refer to Note 18)
and  consistent  performance  across certain key  operations  despite  difficult
global economic conditions. The Coca-Cola system sold 18.7 billion unit cases in
2002.

Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
- ---------------------------------------
Our financial  statements  include the accounts of The Coca-Cola Company and all
subsidiaries.  We consolidate all entities that our Company controls,  and we do
not have any unconsolidated "special purpose" entities. Under current accounting
guidance,  our  Company is not  permitted  to  consolidate  companies  we do not
control.  For  investments in companies in which we have the ability to exercise
significant  influence over operating and financial policies,  such entities are
accounted  for by the  equity  method.  Our  judgments  regarding  the  level of
influence of each equity method investment include  considering key factors such
as  our  ownership  interest,  representation  on  the  board  of  directors,
participation in policy making decisions and material intercompany transactions.
Consolidated  net income  includes  our  Company's  share of the net earnings of
these  companies.  The difference  between  consolidation  and the equity method
impacts  certain  financial  ratios because of the  presentation of the detailed
line items reported in the financial  statements.  However, our consolidated net
income for the period and our share-owners'  equity at the end of the period are
the same whether the investment in the company is accounted for under the equity
method or the  company  is  consolidated.  We record  our  investments  in other
companies  that we do not  control  and for which we do not have the  ability to
exercise  significant  influence  under the cost method.  In accordance with the
cost method, the assets are recorded at cost or fair value, as appropriate.  Our
Company  eliminates  from our  financial  results all  significant  intercompany
transactions, including transactions with equity method investees.

     Our  CCEAG  business  combination  represents  a good  example  related  to
consolidation and management's  consideration  regarding  control.  We concluded
that CCEAG should be consolidated with our Company based on the following.

     Prior to February  2002,  our Company  accounted for CCEAG under the equity
method of  accounting.  Our  Company  has an  approximate  41 percent  ownership
interest in the outstanding shares of CCEAG. In accordance with the terms of the
CPL, our Company  obtained control of CCEAG for a period of up to five years. In
return for control of CCEAG, the Company guaranteed annual payments,  in lieu of
dividends by CCEAG,  to all other CCEAG share  owners.  Additionally,  all other
CCEAG share owners entered into either a put or put/call  option  agreement with
the Company, exercisable at the end of the term of the CPL at agreed prices. Our
Company entered into either put or put/call  agreements for shares  representing
an approximate 59 percent  interest in CCEAG. The spread in the strike prices of
the put and call options is only approximately 3 percent.

     Since the terms of the CPL transfer  control and all of the economic  risks
and rewards of CCEAG to the Company immediately, we determined consolidation was
appropriate. Refer to Note 18.

Recoverability of Noncurrent Assets
- -----------------------------------
Management's  assessment of the  recoverability  of noncurrent  assets  involves
critical accounting estimates. The relevant factors for assessing recoverability
for each  classification  of  noncurrent  assets are  discussed  below.  For the
following assets,  tests of impairment are performed if certain conditions exist
that may indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.

intangible assets, was $192 million.

     For the  following  assets,  tests of  impairment  are  performed  at least
annually.  Impairment  tests would be  performed  more  frequently  if events or
circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired.

     Operating  in  more  than  200  countries  subjects  our  Company  to  many
uncertainties  and  potential   changes  in  various  economic,   political  and
regulatory environments.  As a result, many assumptions about the recoverability
of noncurrent assets must be made by management.  Two examples of such economic,
political and regulatory changes are as follows. First, Germany recently enacted
changes  in  the  deposit  laws  on  nonreturnable   packages.   Many  retailers
significantly  lowered their inventory level on selected package types.  Looking
forward,  the  Coca-Cola  system is well  positioned  to  manage  trends in both
returnable and  nonreturnable  packages.  Second,  if the political and economic
situation  in the  Middle  East  results  in a  continued  deterioration  of the
business  environment,  our business results and the valuation of our noncurrent
assets  could be  impacted.  Currently,  these items have not required a charge;
however, we will continue to monitor these situations as they develop.

Equity Method and Cost Method Investments
- -----------------------------------------
The most significant judgment in management's  recoverability assessments is the
determination   of  the  fair  value  of  our  equity  method  and  cost  method
investments.  For  most  publicly  traded  investments,  the  fair  value of our
Company's  investment is often readily  available based on quoted market prices.
For non-publicly  traded investments,  management's  assessment of fair value is
based on valuation  methodologies  including discounted cash flows, estimates of
sales  proceeds  and  external  appraisals,  as  appropriate.   The  ability  to
accurately  predict future cash flows,  especially in markets such as the Middle
East, Africa and Latin America,  may impact the determination of fair value. The
current  unstable  economic  and  political  conditions  and civil unrest in the
Middle East,  northern  Africa and Venezuela could have an adverse impact on our
Company's business results and valuation of assets in those regions.

     In the event a decline in fair value of an  investment  occurs,  management
may be  required  to  determine  if the  decline  in market  value is other than
temporary.  Management's assessments as to the nature of a decline in fair value
are based on the  valuation  methodologies  discussed  above and our ability and
intent to hold the investment. If the fair value is less than the carrying value
and  the  decline  in  value  is  considered  to be  other  than  temporary,  an
appropriate  write-down is recorded.

     Management's  assessments of fair value in accordance  with these valuation
methodologies  represent  our best  estimates  as of the time of the  impairment
review and are  consistent  with our internal  planning.  The estimates  used by
management  can change over time as such amounts are influenced by future events
and factors. If different fair values were estimated, this could have a material
impact on the

                     The Coca-Cola Company and Subsidiaries

financial  statements.  Furthermore,  conditions  in  markets  around  the world
change,  and thus our  accounting  estimates  may change  from period to period.
External   factors  outside  the  control  of  management  can  be  elements  in
determining estimates related to these investments. Factors that management must
estimate when  performing  impairment  tests include,  among other items,  sales
volume,  prices,  inflation,  marketing  spending,  exchange  rates and  capital
spending.

     An example of  management's  assessment and recognition of impairment of an
investment is as follows.  In the first quarter of 2002, our Company  recorded a
noncash  pretax charge of  approximately  $157 million  (recorded in the caption
Other  Income  (Loss)--Net)  primarily   related  to  the  write-down  of  our
investments in Latin America.  This write-down reduced the carrying value of the
investments in Latin America to fair value.  The charge was primarily the result
of the  economic  developments  in Argentina  during the first  quarter of 2002,
including  the  devaluation  of the  Argentine  peso  and  the  severity  of the
unfavorable economic outlook.

Other Assets
- ------------
Our  Company  invests in  infrastructure  programs  with our  bottlers  that are
directed at  strengthening  our bottling system and increasing unit case volume.
Additionally,  our  Company  advances  payments  to  certain  customers  to fund
marketing  activities intended to generate  profitable volume.  Advance payments
are also made to certain customers for distribution rights. Payments under these
programs  are  generally  capitalized  as Other  Assets on our  balance  sheets.
Management   periodically  evaluates  the  recoverability  of  these  assets  by
preparing  estimates of sales volume, the resulting gross profit, cash flows and
other  factors.   Accuracy  of  our  recoverability   assessments  is  based  on
management's  ability to accurately  predict certain key variables such as sales
volume,  prices,  inflation,  marketing  spending,  exchange  rates and  capital
spending.  Predicting  these key  variables  involves  uncertainty  about future
events; however, the assumptions used are consistent with our internal planning.
If the  assets are  assessed  to be  recoverable,  they are  amortized  over the
periods benefited. If the carrying value of these assets is considered to be not
recoverable, such assets are written down as appropriate.

     The assumptions and conditions for Other Assets reflect  management's  best
assumptions and estimates.  However, these items involve inherent uncertainties,
as described  above,  which may or may not be  controllable  by  management.  An
example of a variable we can  influence is  increasing  marketing  spending in a
particular market.  Bankruptcy or economic  challenges of a particular  customer
represent uncertainties that are not controllable by management. As a result, if
other  assumptions  and  estimates  had been  used in the  current  period,  the
balances for Other Assets could have been materially impacted.  Furthermore,  if
management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur in future
periods, future operating results could be materially impacted.

     During each quarter in 2002,  management considered and analyzed impairment
indicators related to Other Assets. Based on our analysis,  we concluded that no
material items recorded in Other Assets required an impairment charge.

Property, Plant and Equipment
- -----------------------------
Certain events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the  recoverability
of the carrying amount of Property, Plant and Equipment should be assessed. Such
events or  changes  may  include a  significant  decrease  in  market  value,  a
significant  change  in  the  business  climate  in a  particular  market,  or a
current-period  operating or cash flow loss combined with  historical  losses or
projected  future  losses.  If an event occurs or changes in  circumstances  are
present,  we estimate  the future cash flows  expected to result from the use of
the asset and its eventual  disposition.  If the sum of the expected future cash
flows  (undiscounted  and without  interest  charges) is less than the  carrying
amount,  we recognize an impairment  loss. The impairment loss recognized is the
amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value.

     The ability to accurately predict future cash flows, especially in emerging
and developing  markets such as the Middle East,  Africa and Latin America,  may
impact the determination of fair value.  Management's  assessments of cash flows
represent  our best  estimate  as of the time of the  impairment  review and are
consistent  with  our  internal  planning.  If  different  cash  flows  had been
estimated in the current  period,  the Property,  Plant and  Equipment  balances
could have been materially impacted.  Furthermore,  our accounting estimates may
change from period to period as conditions  in markets  around the world change,
and this could  materially  impact our results in future  periods.  Factors that
management must estimate when performing  impairment tests include,  among other
items, sales volume,

prices, inflation, marketing spending, exchange rates and capital spending.

     During each quarter in 2002,  management considered and analyzed impairment
indicators related to Property,  Plant and Equipment.  Based on our analysis, we
concluded  that no material  items  recorded in  Property,  Plant and  Equipment
required an impairment charge.

Goodwill, Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets
- ------------------------------------------------
Effective January 1, 2002, our Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 142,  "Goodwill and Other Intangible  Assets." The adoption
of SFAS No. 142 was required in accordance with accounting  principles generally
accepted in the United States,  and no adoption  alternatives are allowed.  Such
statement  required an initial impairment  assessment  involving a comparison of
the fair value of goodwill,  trademarks and other  intangible  assets to current
carrying value.  Upon adoption,  we recorded a loss for the cumulative effect of
accounting  change for SFAS No. 142,  net of income  taxes,  of $367 million for
Company  operations  and $559 million for equity  investees.  As required by the
standard,  we did not  restate  prior  periods.  The  adoption  of SFAS No.  142
resulted in a pretax reduction in 2002 amortization expense of approximately $60
million, and 2002 equity income increased by approximately $150 million.

     SFAS No.  142  classifies  intangible  assets  into three  categories:  (1)
intangible  assets with definite lives subject to  amortization;  (2) intangible
assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization;  and (3) goodwill. For
intangible assets with definite lives, tests for impairment must be performed if
conditions  exist that indicate the carrying value may not be  recoverable.  For
intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill,  tests for impairment must
be performed at least annually.  Such tests for impairment are also required for
intangible assets recorded by our equity method investees.

     Our  trademarks  and other  intangible  assets  determined to have definite
lives are amortized over their useful lives. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, if
conditions  exist that indicate the carrying  value may not be  recoverable,  we
review such  trademarks  and other  intangible  assets with  definite  lives for
impairment to ensure they are appropriately  valued. Such conditions may include
an  economic  downturn  in a market  or a change  in the  assessment  of  future
operations.  Trademarks  and  other  intangible  assets  determined  to  have an
indefinite  useful life are not  amortized.  We test such  trademarks  and other
intangible assets with indefinite  useful lives for impairment  annually or more
frequently  if events or  circumstances  indicate that assets might be impaired.
Goodwill is not amortized.  We perform tests for impairment of goodwill annually
or more  frequently  if events or  circumstances  indicate it might be impaired.
Such  tests  include  comparing  the fair  value of a  reporting  unit  with its
carrying value, including goodwill. Impairment assessments are performed using a
variety of  methodologies,  including  cash flow  analysis,  estimates  of sales
proceeds and independent appraisals.  Where applicable,  an appropriate discount
rate is used,  based on the Company's cost of capital rate or  location-specific
economic  factors.  In 2002, we tested goodwill for  impairment.  Based on these
assessments, we concluded that such assets did not require an impairment charge.

     Management  estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use
and, if applicable,  the eventual  disposition of the assets.  The key variables
that management must estimate include,  among other items, sales volume, prices,
inflation,  marketing spending, exchange rates and capital spending. Significant
management judgment is involved in estimating these variables,  and they include
inherent  uncertainties;  however,  the assumptions used are consistent with our
internal planning.  Management  periodically evaluates and updates the estimates
based on the  conditions  that  influence  these  variables.  If such assets are
considered impaired, they are written down to fair value as appropriate.

     The  assumptions   and  conditions  for  goodwill,   trademarks  and  other
intangible assets reflect management's best assumptions and estimates.  However,
these items involve inherent uncertainties,  as described above, that may or may
not be controllable by management.  An example of a variable we can influence is
increasing  marketing  spending in a particular  market.  Economic and political
conditions,  such as civil  unrest in the Middle East,  represent  uncertainties
that are not controllable by management.  As a result,  if other assumptions and
conditions  had been used in the current  period,  the  balances  for  goodwill,
trademarks  and other  intangible  assets could have been  materially  impacted.
Furthermore, if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions
occur in future periods, future operating results could be materially impacted.

Contingencies
- -------------
Our Company is involved in various legal  proceedings.  Refer to Note 11. Due to
their nature, such legal proceedings involve inherent  uncertainties  including,
but not limited to, court rulings,  negotiations  between  affected  parties and
governmental intervention.  Management assesses the probability of loss for such
contingencies   and  accrues  a  liability   and/or   discloses   the   relevant
circumstances,  as  appropriate.  Management  believes that any liability to the
Company that may arise as a result of currently  pending legal  proceedings will
not have a material  adverse  effect on the  financial  condition of the Company
taken as a whole.

Adoption of New Accounting Policy-Stock-Based Compensation
- ----------------------------------------------------------
Our Company  currently  sponsors stock option plans and  restricted  stock award
plans.  Prior  to  2002,  our  Company  accounted  for  those  plans  under  the
recognition  and measurement  provisions of APB Opinion No. 25,  "Accounting for
Stock  Issued  to  Employees"  (APB  No.  25) and  related  interpretations.  No
stock-based employee compensation expense for stock options was reflected in Net
Income for the years  ended  December  31, 2001 and 2000,  as all stock  options
granted  under those plans had an exercise  price equal to the fair market value
of the underlying common stock on the date of grant.  Effective January 1, 2002,
our Company adopted the preferable fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No.
123,  "Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation." Under the modified prospective
transition  method  selected  by our  Company  as  described  in SFAS  No.  148,
"Accounting   for   Stock-Based    Compensation-Transition    and   Disclosure,"
compensation  cost recognized in 2002 of approximately  $365 million is the same
as that which would have been  recognized  had the fair value method of SFAS No.
123 been applied from its original effective date. The 2002 expense was recorded
in the caption Selling,  General and Administrative Expenses. In accordance with
the modified  prospective  method of adoption,  results for prior years have not
been restated.

     Our Company voluntarily made a choice to change to the preferable method of
accounting  for  employee  stock  options in  accordance  with SFAS No.  123. We
concluded that stock options are a form of employee  compensation  expense,  and
therefore  it is  appropriate  that these  costs be  recorded  in our  financial
results  to  more  clearly  reflect  economic  reality.  Refer  to  the  heading
"Corporate Governance."

     Our Company uses the  Black-Scholes  option-pricing  model to determine the
fair value of each option  grant.  To ensure the best  market-based  assumptions
were used to determine  the  estimated  fair value of stock  options  granted in
2002, we obtained two independent market quotes. Our Black-Scholes value was not
materially  different  from the  independent  quotes.  The  Black-Scholes  model
includes assumptions  regarding dividend yields,  expected volatility,  expected
lives and risk-free interest rates. These assumptions reflect  management's best
estimates,  but  these  items  involve  inherent  uncertainties  based on market
conditions  generally  outside of the control of our  Company.  As a result,  if
other assumptions had been used in the current period,  stock-based compensation
expense could have been  materially  impacted.  Furthermore,  if management uses
different assumptions in future periods,  stock-based compensation expense could
be materially impacted in future years.

     Refer to Notes 1 and 13.

Net Operating Revenues and Gross Profit
- ---------------------------------------
Net Operating Revenues increased by $2,019 million in 2002 versus 2001. The
2001 increase compared to 2000 was $191 million.

     The following table indicates,  on a percentage basis, the estimated impact
of key factors resulting in significant  increases  (decreases) in Net Operating
Revenues:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Increases in gallon shipments,  price increases and  product/geographic mix
in selected countries  positively impacted our 2002 Net Operating Revenues.  The
improvements in these core business factors  reflected a positive trend in 2002.
Furthermore,  the acquisitions of our interests in Odwalla, Inc. (Odwalla), CCDA
Waters,  L.L.C.  (CCDA)  and CBC  also  contributed  to the  increased  2002 Net
Operating Revenues.

     The  most  significant   structural  change  (defined  by  the  Company  as
purchasing  and  disposing of bottling and canning  operations)  in 2002 was the
consolidation of CCEAG. This  consolidation was partially offset by the sale and
resulting deconsolidation of our Russian and Baltics bottling operations.

     The combined 2002 Net Operating Revenues for the structural change of CCEAG
and  the   acquisitions  of  our  interests  in  Odwalla,   CCDA  and  CBC  were
approximately  $1.5  billion.   The  Russian  and  Baltics  bottling  operations
accounted for approximately $150 million of 2001 Net Operating Revenues.

     The  continued  strength of the U.S.  dollar in 2002 relative to most major
currencies had a negative  impact on Net Operating  Revenues.  The stronger U.S.
dollar  compared to the Japanese yen, the Argentine  peso, the Mexican peso, the
Brazilian real, the Venezuelan  bolivar and the South African rand was partially
offset by strength in the euro. For further discussion of the impact of exchange
and expected trends, refer to the heading "Exchange."

     In 2001,  gallon  shipments  and  price  increases  in  selected  countries
positively  impacted Net  Operating  Revenues,  offset by a negative  impact for
product/geographic mix.

     Consolidation  of the  Nordic and  Brazilian  bottling  operations  in 2001
represented  structural changes increasing Net Operating  Revenues.  The sale of
our  previously  owned  vending  operations  in Japan and canning  operations in
Germany offset these increases.

     Again, a stronger U.S. dollar in 2001 relative to most major currencies had
a negative impact on Net Operating Revenues.

     Our Cost of Goods Sold  increased in 2002  compared to 2001  primarily as a
result of the  acquisitions  of our  interests in Odwalla,  CCDA and CBC and the
structural  change of CCEAG.  Total  combined  2002 Cost of Goods Sold for these
entities was $844 million.

     Our  decrease  in  2002  Gross  Profit  margin  was  due  primarily  to the
consolidation of lower-margin operations,  primarily the CCEAG structural change
and the acquisitions of our interests in Odwalla,  CCDA and CBC. These decreases
were partially offset by the sale and resulting  deconsolidation  of our Russian
and  Baltics  bottling  operations.  Our Gross  Profit  margin  increase in 2001
compared to 2000 was  primarily due to the sale in 2001 of our Japan vending and
German canning operations,  partially offset by the consolidation in 2001 of the
Nordic and  Brazilian  bottling  operations.  Generally,  bottling,  canning and
vending  operations produce higher net revenues but lower gross margins compared
to concentrate and syrup operations.

     In 2000, certain bottlers reduced their concentrate  inventory levels. This
was based on a joint review performed by the Company and our bottlers around the
world  in  order  to  determine  the  optimum   level  of  bottler   concentrate
inventories.  The joint review established that opportunities  existed to reduce
the level of concentrate inventory carried by bottlers in various regions of the
world.  During  the  first  half of  2000,  bottlers  in these  regions  reduced
concentrate  inventory  levels,  the majority of which occurred during the first
three months of 2000.  This reduction in bottler  concentrate  inventory  levels
negatively  impacted  our  Company's  concentrate  sales,  thereby  reducing Net
Operating Revenues, Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit.

                                                         2002 ANNUAL REPORT - 59

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The 2002 Net  Operating  Revenues  for  Europe,  Eurasia  and  Middle  East
increased primarily due to the consolidation of CCEAG. Net Operating Revenues in
2002 for Latin America were  negatively  impacted by exchange  fluctuations  and
challenging economic conditions,  primarily in Argentina,  Venezuela and Brazil.
As indicated by the table, changes from 2000 to 2001 were not significant.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
- --------------------------------------------
The following table includes the significant components of Selling,  General and
Administrative Expenses (in millions):

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,                 2002            2001            2000

Selling, General and
  Administrative Expenses           $  7,001        $  6,149        $  6,016
============================================================================

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Acquisitions  of our interests in Odwalla,  CCDA and CBC and the structural
change of CCEAG  increased  selling  expenses  by $430  million  and general and
administrative  expenses by $136 million in 2002. These increases were partially
offset by the sale and  resulting  deconsolidation  of our  Russian  and Baltics
bottling operations.

     The  adoption of SFAS No. 142 and its  related  impact is  discussed  under
"Application  of  Critical  Accounting  Policies"  and in  Notes  1 and 4.  Upon
adoption  of SFAS No. 142,  intangible  assets  that have  indefinite  lives and
goodwill  previously  amortized are no longer amortized.  Due to the adoption of
SFAS No. 142,  amortization  expense for 2002 was reduced by  approximately  $60
million, and future years will be reduced by approximately $60 million annually.
Substantially  all such  amortization  expense  was  included in the general and
administrative expenses line item.

     As discussed  under  "Application of Critical  Accounting  Policies" and in
Notes 1 and 13,  effective  January 1, 2002, our Company  adopted the preferable
fair value  recognition  provisions  of SFAS No. 123 and  selected  the modified
prospective  transition  method under the  provisions of SFAS No. 148.  Prior to
2002, our Company accounted for stock-based  compensation  under the recognition
and  measurement  provisions  of APB  No.  25 and  related  interpretations.  No
stock-based employee compensation expense for stock options was reflected in Net
Income for the years ended  December  31, 2001 and 2000.  In 2002,  compensation
expense  was  recognized  as if the fair  value  method of SFAS No. 123 had been
applied from its original effective date.

     Acquisitions  and  structural  changes  increased   Selling,   General  and
Administrative  Expenses by approximately  $45 million in 2001 compared to 2000.
The  consolidation  in 2001 of the  Nordic  and  Brazilian  bottling  operations
accounted for a majority of the increase.  The sale in 2001 of our Japan vending
and German canning operations partially offset this increase.

     A stronger U.S. dollar relative to most major currencies decreased Selling,
General and  Administrative  Expenses in 2002  compared to 2001 and also in 2001
compared to 2000.

Pension Benefits
- ----------------
Net periodic cost for our defined  benefit  pension  plans was $72 million,  $62
million and $39 million,  respectively,  for the years ended  December 31, 2002,
2001 and 2000.  These  expenses  are  included  in  general  and  administrative
expenses.

     To develop our expected  long-term rate of return assumption on our pension
plan assets, our Company uses long-term historical actual return experience, the
expected  investment mix of the plans' assets and estimates of future  long-term
investment returns.  The expected long-term rate of return assumption is used in
the net periodic pension cost  calculation.  This assumption is reviewed and set
annually.  For 2003,  our  weighted-average  expected  long-term  rate of return
assumption  will be  approximately  7 1/4  percent  compared to 8 1/4 percent in
2002. The discount rate  assumption used for pension  accounting  reflects rates
available on high-quality,  fixed-income debt instruments on December 31 of each
year.

      FINANCIAL REVIEW INCORPORATING MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
                     The Coca-Cola Company and Subsidiaries

The rate of  compensation  increase  is  another  assumption  used  for  pension
accounting and is determined by the Company based upon annual reviews.

     The decrease in our  expected  weighted-average,  long-term  rate of return
assumption,   a  decrease  in  our  discount  rate   assumption   and  increased
amortization  of  actuarial  losses is  expected to  increase  our net  periodic
pension cost by $30 million to $40 million in 2003 compared to 2002.

     Our Company  funds the U.S.  qualified  pension  plans in  accordance  with
Employee  Retirement  Income  Security Act (ERISA)  regulations  for the minimum
annual  contribution and with Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations for the
maximum annual contribution allowable as a tax deduction.  International pension
plans are funded in accordance with local laws and income tax regulations.

     As of December 31, 2002,  the projected  benefit  obligation of the primary
qualified  U.S.  pension  plan was  $1,205  million,  and the fair value of plan
assets was $1,028 million.  In 2002, we made a contribution to this plan of $124
million, which was the maximum  tax-deductible  contribution allowed by the IRS.
In January 2003, we made a contribution to the plan of $145 million.

     As of December 31, 2002,  the  projected  benefit  obligation  of all other
pension  plans was $977  million,  and the fair value of all other  pension plan
assets was $424 million.  The majority of this  difference is attributable to an
international  pension plan for certain non-U.S.  employees that is unfunded due
to tax law  restrictions,  as well as our  unfunded  U.S.  nonqualified  pension
plans.  These U.S.  nonqualified  pension  plans  provide  benefits  for certain
members of management  that are not  permitted to be funded  through a qualified
plan because of limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.

     Refer to Note 14.

Other Operating Charges
- -----------------------
During 2000, we recorded total Other Operating  Charges of approximately  $1,443
million.  Of this $1,443  million,  approximately  $405  million  related to the
impairment  of  certain   bottling,   manufacturing   and   intangible   assets;
approximately  $850 million related to the Realignment;  and approximately  $188
million  related  to the  settlement  terms  of a  class  action  discrimination
lawsuit.

     In the first quarter of 2000,  we recorded  charges of  approximately  $405
million  related  to the  impairment  of  certain  bottling,  manufacturing  and
intangible  assets,  primarily  within our  Indian  bottling  operations.  These
impairment  charges were recorded to reduce the carrying value of the identified
assets to fair  value.  Fair value was  derived  using cash flow  analysis.  The
assumptions  used in the cash flow analysis were  consistent  with those used in
our internal  planning.  The assumptions  included estimates of future growth in
unit  cases,  gross  margins,  the  impact of  exchange  rates and tax rates and
incentives.  The charge was primarily the result of our revised  outlook for the
Indian  beverage  market  including  the future  expected tax  environment.  The
remaining  carrying  value of  long-lived  assets  within  our  Indian  bottling
operations, immediately after recording the impairment charge, was approximately
$300 million.

     In the first quarter of 2000, the Company initiated the Realignment,  which
reduced our workforce around the world and transferred responsibilities from our
corporate headquarters to local  revenue-generating  operating units. The intent
of the Realignment  was to effectively  align our corporate  resources,  support
systems and business  culture to fully  leverage the local  capabilities  of our
system.

     Employees were separated from almost all functional  areas of the Company's
operations,  and certain activities were outsourced to third parties.  The total
number of employees  separated as of December 31, 2000 was approximately  5,200.
Employees separated from the Company as a result of the Realignment were offered
severance or early  retirement  packages,  as  appropriate,  which included both
financial and nonfinancial  components.  The Realignment expenses included costs
associated with involuntary terminations, voluntary retirements and other direct
costs associated with implementing the Realignment.  Other direct costs included
repatriating and relocating employees to local markets; asset write-downs; lease
cancellation costs; and costs associated with the development, communication and
administration  of the  Realignment.  We recorded total charges of approximately
$850  million  related to the  Realignment.  During 2000,  the Company  achieved
approximately $150 million in savings from the Realignment. Refer to Note 17.

     In the fourth quarter of 2000, we recorded  charges of  approximately  $188
million related to the settlement terms of, and direct costs related to, a class
action discrimination lawsuit. The monetary settlement included cash payments to
fund  back  pay,  compensatory  damages,  a  promotional  achievement  fund  and

Information  about our  Operating  Income by  operating  segment on a percentage
basis is as follows:

=============================================================================

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     As  demonstrated  by the table above,  the percentage  contribution by each
operating  segment to Operating Income  fluctuated from year to year.  Operating
Income  was  influenced  by a variety  of  factors  and  events,  primarily  the
following items:

   - In 2002, Latin America was negatively impacted by exchange fluctuations and
     challenging  economic  conditions,  primarily in  Argentina,  Venezuela and
     Brazil.

   - In 2002,  Operating  Income was reduced by $119 million for North  America,
     $24  million for  Africa,  $51  million for Europe,  Eurasia and the Middle
     East, $22 million for Latin America,  $51 million for Asia and $106 million
     for  Corporate  to include the impact of adopting  the fair value method of
     accounting for stock-based compensation under SFAS No. 123.

   - In the first  quarter of 2000,  Operating  Income was reduced by $3 million
     for North  America,  $397  million  for Asia and $5 million  for  Corporate
     related to the other operating charges recorded for asset impairments.

   - The Realignment in 2000 accounted for operating charges of $132 million for
     North America, $40 million for Africa, $198 million for Europe, Eurasia and
     Middle East, $59 million for Latin America,  $127 million for Asia and $294
     million for Corporate.

   - In 2000,  a $188 million  charge was  recorded by Corporate  related to the
     settlement terms of a discrimination  lawsuit,  including a donation to The
     Coca-Cola Foundation.

   - As  previously  discussed,   certain  bottlers  reduced  their  concentrate
     inventory levels in 2000. This reduction negatively impacted 2000 Operating
     Income and Operating Margin.

Interest Income and Interest Expense
- ------------------------------------
A majority of the 2002 decrease of $116 million in Interest  Income  compared to
2001 was due to lower  interest  rates earned on short-term  investments  during
2002.  Nevertheless,  the Company  continues  to benefit  from cash  invested in
locations  outside the United States earning higher interest rates than could be
obtained  within the United  States.  Conversely,  a  majority  of our  Interest
Expense is incurred on  borrowings  in the United  States.  The 2002 decrease in
interest expense of $90 million versus 2001 was due mainly to both a decrease in
average  commercial  paper  borrowings  and lower  interest rates for commercial
paper  borrowings.  The  decrease  in  interest  expense  for  commercial  paper
borrowings was partially offset by increased  interest expense on long-term debt
related to the consolidation of CCEAG (refer to Note 18) and the issuance during
2002 of $750  million of notes due June 1,  2005.  The  proceeds  from this $750
million  long-term debt issuance were used to reduce current debt (refer to Note
7).

     In 2001,  our Interest  Income  decreased by $20 million  primarily  due to
lower interest rates.  Interest Expense decreased in 2001 by $158 million due to
both a decrease in average commercial paper borrowings and lower interest rates.
In 2001, the Company used cash flow from operations  after capital  expenditures
to reduce commercial paper borrowings.

      FINANCIAL REVIEW INCORPORATING MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
                     The Coca-Cola Company and Subsidiaries

Equity Income (Loss)
- --------------------
A $232 million  increase in 2002 Equity Income (Loss),  as compared to 2001, was
due to the overall improving health of the Coca-Cola  bottling system around the
world  and the  favorable  impact of  reduced  amortization  resulting  from the
adoption of SFAS No. 142. Specific items with a positive impact to Equity Income
(Loss)  were  the  increase  in  equity  income  for  Coca-Cola  Enterprises  of
approximately  $209 million due to improving  trends in operating  and financial
performance  (which included a $90 million  favorable  impact resulting from the
adoption  of SFAS  No.  142)  and the  reduction  in  amortization  expenses  of
approximately  $60  million for  investments  other than  Coca-Cola  Enterprises
resulting from the  implementation  of SFAS No. 142. Due to the adoption of SFAS
No. 142,  Equity  Income  (Loss) for 2002 was  increased by  approximately  $150
million,  and future  years will be  increased  by  approximately  $150  million
annually  as a result of reduced  amortization  expense.  These  increases  were
offset by selected  equity  method  investments  in Latin America that have been
adversely  impacted by ongoing economic  difficulties,  as well as our Company's
share of impairment  and  restructuring  charges taken by certain  equity method
investees in Latin America during the third quarter of 2002. The Company's share
of these charges was approximately $33 million.

     For 2002,  our Company's  share of income from equity method  investees was
also  favorably  impacted  by a benefit  related to our share of the gain on the
sale by  Cervejarias  Kaiser S.A.  (Kaiser S.A.) of its interests in Cervejarias
Kaiser Brazil, Ltda to Molson Inc. (refer to Note 16). Approximately $21 million
of our share of the pretax  gain from the sale by Kaiser  S.A.  was  recorded in
Equity Income (Loss) with the remaining  portion,  $22 million,  recorded in the
caption Other Income (Loss)--Net.

     Our  Company's  share of income from  equity  method  investments  in 2001,
versus  a loss in  2000,  was  due  primarily  to an  improvement  in  operating
performance by the majority of our equity investees and the impact of impairment
charges on equity investees in 2000 as discussed below.

     As of  January  1,  2001,  Coca-Cola  Enterprises  changed  its  method  of
accounting for  infrastructure  development  payments received from the Company.
Prior to this change, Coca-Cola Enterprises recognized these payments as offsets
to  incremental  expenses  of the  programs  in the  periods  in which they were
incurred.  Coca-Cola  Enterprises now recognizes the infrastructure  development
payments  received  from the Company as income when  obligations  are  performed
under the  contracts.  Because we eliminate the financial  effect of significant
intercompany transactions (including transactions with equity method investees),
this change in accounting  method by Coca-Cola  Enterprises had no impact on the
results of our operations. Refer to Note 2.

     In 2000,  our  Company's  share of losses  from equity  method  investments
totaled $289 million.  This included a charge of approximately  $306 million for
the  Company's  portion of a charge  recorded by Coca-Cola  Amatil to reduce the
carrying value of its investment in the  Philippines.  In addition,  Panamerican
Beverages,  Inc. (Panamco) wrote down selected assets,  including the impairment
of the value of its Venezuelan  operating  unit.  The Company's  portion of this
charge was  approximately  $124 million.  Also contributing to the equity losses
were charges recorded by investees in Eurasia and the Middle East. These charges
were partially offset by an overall improvement in operating  performance by our
investee  bottlers  and the  positive  impact of lower tax rates on current  and
deferred taxes at CCEAG.

Other Income (Loss)--Net
- ------------------------
Other Income  (Loss)--Net in 2002 was  principally  composed of foreign currency
exchange losses of approximately  $118 million,  the accretion of the discounted
value of the CCEAG  liability of  approximately  $38 million (refer to Note 18),
the items discussed in this section below and minority  interest  accruals.  The
losses on currency  exchange  primarily  occurred  in Latin  America and Africa,
which  experienced  significant  devaluation of currencies.  The increase in the
minority  interest  accruals  primarily  related  to  the  acquisitions  of  our
interests in CBC and CCDA. Refer to Note 18.

     In the first quarter of 2002, our Company  recorded a noncash pretax charge
of approximately  $157 million,  primarily  related to the write-down of certain
investments in Latin America.  This write-down reduced the carrying value of the
investments  to fair value.  The charge was primarily the result of the economic
developments  in  Argentina  during  the first  quarter of 2002,  including  the
devaluation of the Argentine peso and the severity of the  unfavorable  economic
conditions.  The  Company  expects to realize a minimal  tax  benefit  from this
write-down.  The  impact on 2002  diluted  earnings  per share was an  after-tax
reduction of approximately $0.06 per share


                                                         2002 ANNUAL REPORT - 63

      FINANCIAL REVIEW INCORPORATING MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
                     The Coca-Cola Company and Subsidiaries

     As previously  noted,  $22 million of our share of the pretax gain from the
sale by Kaiser S.A. was recorded in Other Income (Loss)--Net in 2002.

     In 2001, Other Income  (Loss)--Net declined to $39 million from $99 million
in 2000,  primarily  reflecting  the  impact of a gain  related to the merger of
Coca-Cola  Beverages and Hellenic Bottling Company S.A. during the third quarter
of 2000.  This merger resulted in a decrease of our Company's  equity  ownership
interest from  approximately 51 percent of Coca-Cola  Beverages to approximately
24 percent of the combined entity, CCHBC. As a result of our Company's decreased
equity  ownership,  a tax-free  noncash gain of  approximately  $118 million was
recognized.

Gains on Issuances of Stock by Equity Investee
- ----------------------------------------------
If and when an equity  investee  issues its stock to third parties at a price in
excess of our book value,  our Company's  equity in the underlying net assets of
that  investee  increases.  We  generally  record an increase to our  investment
account and a corresponding gain for these transactions. In July 2001, Coca-Cola
Enterprises   completed  its  acquisition  of  Hondo   Incorporated  and  Herbco
Enterprises,  Inc.,  collectively  known as Herb Coca-Cola.  The transaction was
valued at  approximately  $1.4  billion,  with  approximately  30 percent of the
transaction  funded with the  issuance  of  approximately  25 million  shares of
Coca-Cola  Enterprises  common stock,  and the remaining  portion funded through
debt and assumed debt. The issuance of shares  resulted in a noncash pretax gain
for our Company of approximately $91 million.  This gain represents the increase
in our Company's equity in the underlying net assets of the related investee. No
gains on issuances of stock by equity  investees were recorded to our statements
of income during 2002 or 2000. Refer to Note 3.

Income Taxes
- ------------
Our effective tax rate reflects tax benefits derived from significant operations
outside the United  States,  which are  generally  taxed at rates lower than the
U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent.

     The  effective  tax rate  for  2002 of 27.7  percent  was  impacted  by two
significant  items:  our share of the gain on the sale of Kaiser S.A.  interests
and the write-down of certain investments, primarily in Latin America. Excluding
the impact of these items, our effective tax rate would have been  approximately
27 percent for 2002.  For 2003,  the Company  expects the ongoing  effective tax
rate to be approximately 27 percent.

     The  decrease  in  our  effective  tax rate in  2001 was  primarily  due to
effective tax planning and the impact that the  impairment  charges  recorded in
2000  had on the 2000  effective  tax  rate.  The  2000  effective  tax rate was
primarily the result of our inability to realize a tax benefit  associated  with
the  impairment  charges  recorded in 2000,  as previously  discussed  under the
headings "Other Operating  Charges" and "Equity Income (Loss)," partially offset
by the tax-free  gain of  approximately  $118  million  related to the merger of
Coca-Cola  Beverages and Hellenic  Bottling Company S.A.,  previously  discussed
under the heading "Other Income (Loss)--Net." Refer to Note 16.

     During the first  quarter of 2000,  the U.S. and Japan  taxing  authorities
entered into an Advance  Pricing  Agreement (APA) whereby the level of royalties
paid by Coca-Cola  (Japan)  Company,  Ltd. (our  Subsidiary)  to our Company was
established  for the years 1993 through 2001.  Pursuant to the terms of the APA,
our Subsidiary filed amended returns for the applicable  periods  reflecting the
negotiated  royalty rate.  These amended returns  resulted in the payment during
the first and second quarters of 2000 of additional  Japanese taxes.  The effect
on our financial  performance  and our effective tax rate was not material,  due
primarily to offsetting tax credits utilized on our U.S. income tax returns. The
majority of the  offsetting  tax credits were  realized in the first  quarter of
2002.

Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change for SFAS No. 142,
Net of Income Taxes
- --------------------------------------------------------
The adoption of SFAS No. 142 is a required change in accounting  principle,  and
the  cumulative  effect of adopting this standard as of January 1, 2002 resulted
in a noncash,  after-tax  decrease  to net income of $367  million  for  Company
operations and $559 million for the Company's  proportionate share of its equity
method  investees.  As noted  above,  the adoption of this  accounting  standard
resulted in a pretax reduction in 2002 amortization expense of approximately $60
million,  and 2002 equity income increased by approximately $150 million. Due to
the adoption of SFAS No. 142,  future years'  amortization  expense will also be
reduced by approximately $60 million  annually,  and equity income will increase
by approximately  $150 million annually as a result of reduced  amortization for
equity  method  investees.   Refer  to  the  heading  "Application  of  Critical
Accounting Policies" and Notes 1 and 4.

Recent Developments
- -------------------
During the first quarter of 2003, the Company  initiated steps to streamline and
simplify its operations, primarily in North America and Germany.

     In North America,  the Company is  integrating  the operations of our three
separate North American business  units-Coca-Cola  North America  (including our
interest in CCDA), The Minute Maid Company  (including our Odwalla business) and
Fountain.  The  integration  is expected to result in a headcount  reduction  of
approximately 1,000 people, with the identification of the individuals  expected
to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2003.

     In  Germany,  CCEAG  has taken  steps to  improve  efficiency  in sales and
distribution,  including  the  closure  of three  bottling  plants in 2003.  The
streamlining  initiative  is expected to affect  approximately  900 employees in
Germany.

     The above  initiatives are expected to result in a full-year 2003 charge to
earnings of  approximately  $400 million on a pretax  basis.  The charge will be
recorded  primarily  in the first and  second  quarters  of 2003,  with  certain
amounts impacting the second half of 2003.

     As a result of the above initiatives,  the Company's  financial results are
expected to benefit by at least $50  million  (pretax) in 2003 and at least $100
million (pretax) on an annualized basis beginning in 2004.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We believe  our  ability to  generate  cash from  operations  to reinvest in our
business is one of our  fundamental  financial  strengths.  We expect cash flows
from  operations  to be strong in 2003 and in future  years.  For the  five-year
period from 2003  through  2007,  we estimate  that  cumulative  cash flows from
operations will be approximately  $31 billion to $33 billion.  Accordingly,  our
Company expects to meet all our financial commitments and operating needs during
this time frame. Cash will be used for marketing commitments and other operating
commitments,  as well as investing and financing  activities,  including capital
expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Cash flows  from  operating  activities  increased  by 15 percent  for 2002
compared to 2001 primarily as a result of improved  worldwide business operating
results.  Additionally,  collection of tax receivables in 2002 of  approximately
$280 million in  connection  with the APA (refer to Note 15)  increased our cash
flows. These increases were partially offset by the following:

     - pension plan  contributions of approximately $124 million made during the
       second quarter of 2002;
     - a stronger U.S. dollar.

                     The Coca-Cola Company and Subsidiaries

     Cash  provided by operating  activities  in 2001  increased 15 percent from
2000.  Solid 2001  business  results  primarily  contributed  to this  increase.
Additionally,  2000  operating  cash  flows  were  unfavorably  impacted  by the
previously   mentioned  planned  inventory  reduction  by  certain  bottlers  as
discussed under the heading "Net Operating  Revenues," cash used in 2000 related
to  Realignment  payments  (refer to Note 17), and tax payments made pursuant to
the terms of the APA. Refer to Note 15. These items were  partially  offset by a
stronger U.S. dollar in 2001.

     During 2002, cash outlays for investing  activities  included  purchases of
property,  plant and  equipment  of $851  million  and the  acquisitions  of our
interests in CBC and CCDA for total combined consideration of approximately $328
million (refer to Note 18). These items were partially  offset by the receipt of
approximately  $146  million in 2002  related to the 2001 sale of our  Company's
ownership interests in various Russian bottling operations.

     The  acquisitions  of the  Brazilian  and Nordic  bottling  operations  and
Odwalla, together with the increased purchases of property, plant and equipment,
primarily  caused  a $23  million  increase  in cash  flows  used  in  investing
activities  in 2001 versus 2000.  Proceeds  received  from the sale of our Japan
vending operations partially offset this increase.

     Total capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment (including our
investments  in  information  technology)  and the  percentage of such totals by
operating segment for 2002, 2001 and 2000 are as follows:

     Issuances  and payments of debt  included  both  short-term  and  long-term
financing activities.  The Company's commercial paper borrowings normally mature
in less than three  months from the date of issuance.  On December 31, 2002,  we
had $2,331  million in lines of credit and other  short- term credit  facilities
available, of which approximately $353 million was outstanding. All of this $353
million relates to our international subsidiaries.

     The issuances of debt in 2002 primarily  included $832 million of issuances
of commercial  paper with  maturities over 90 days and $750 million in issuances
of  long-term  notes due June 1, 2005.  The  payments of debt in 2002  primarily
included $816 million related to commercial  paper with maturities over 90 days,
net payments of $1,280 million related to commercial  paper with maturities less
than 90 days and the $150 million redemption of 6 5/8 percent U.S. dollar notes.

     The issuances of debt in 2001 and 2000  primarily  included  $2,383 million
and  $3,576  million,  respectively,  of  issuances  of  commercial  paper  with
maturities  over 90  days.  In  2001,  we also had a $500  million  issuance  of
long-term debt. The payments of debt in 2001 and 2000 primarily  included $3,864
million  and $3,624  million,  respectively,  related to  commercial  paper with
maturities  over 90  days.  Net  issuances  related  to  commercial  paper  with
maturities  less than 90 days were $40 million in 2001. Net payments  related to
commercial paper with maturities less than 90 days were $317 million in 2000.

                     The Coca-Cola Company and Subsidiaries

     During 2002 and 2001, the Company  repurchased common stock under the share
repurchase  plan  authorized  by our Board of  Directors  in October  1996.  Our
Company expects to make share repurchases of approximately $1.5 billion in 2003.
As cash flows are expected to increase in subsequent years, our subsequent share
repurchases are also expected to increase.

     Dividends have increased  every year for each of the last 41 years,  and we
expect these increases to continue in the future.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate
Contractual Obligations
- ------------------------------------------
Off-Balance  Sheet  Arrangements - In accordance with the  definition  under new
Securities and Exchange  Commission  rules, the following qualify as off-balance
sheet arrangements:

- -  any obligation under certain guarantees or contracts;

- -  a retained or contingent  interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated
   entity or  similar  entity or  similar  arrangement  that  serves as  credit,
   liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets;

- -  any obligation under certain derivative instruments;

- -  any obligation under a material  variable  interest held by the registrant in
   an unconsolidated entity that provides financing,  liquidity,  market risk or
   credit risk  support to the  registrant,  or engages in  leasing,  hedging or
   research and development services with the registrant.

     The discussion below addresses each of the above items for our Company.

     On December 31, 2002, our Company was contingently liable for guarantees of
indebtedness  owed by third  parties in the amount of $494  million.  Management
concluded that the likelihood of any material  amounts being paid by our Company
is not  probable.  We do not provide any other  guarantees.  As of December  31,
2002, we are not liable for the debt of any unconsolidated entity, and we do not
have  any  retained  or  contingent   interest  in  assets  as  defined   above.
Additionally,  all of our  derivative  instruments  are  recorded in our balance
sheets. Refer to Notes 10 and 11.

     Our Company has equity  ownership  interests in bottlers  that we currently
account for under the equity method of  accounting.  For certain  bottlers,  our
Company holds variable interests such as providing financing and guarantees,  in
addition  to  our  equity  investments.  As a  result,  these  bottlers  may  be
considered  variable interest entities,  and it is reasonably  possible that the
Company may be required to  consolidate  such  variable  interest  entities when
Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (FASB)  Interpretation  No. 46  becomes
effective on July 1, 2003. The difference  between  consolidation and the equity
method  impacts  certain  financial  ratios because of the  presentation  of the
detailed line items reported in the financial statements.  However, consolidated
net income for the period and our share-owners'  equity at the end of the period
are the same whether the  investment is accounted for under the equity method or
is consolidated.  We do not expect this interpretation to have a material impact
on our financial statements.


                                                         2002 ANNUAL REPORT - 67

Our  international  operations are subject to certain  opportunities  and risks,

responsive to changing  economic and political  environments and to fluctuations
in foreign currencies.

     We  use  approximately  53  functional   currencies.   Due  to  our  global
operations, weaknesses in some of these currencies are often offset by strengths
in others.  In 2002,  2001 and 2000,  the  weighted-average  exchange  rates for

     These percentages do not include the effects of our hedging activities and,
therefore,  do not reflect the actual impact of  fluctuations in exchange on our
operating  results.  Our  foreign  currency  management  program is  designed to
mitigate,  over  time,  a portion of the  impact of  exchange  on Net Income and
earnings per share.  Taking into account the effects of our hedging  activities,
the  impact  of  a  stronger  U.S.  dollar  reduced  our  Operating   Income  by
approximately   3  percent  in  2002,   approximately  5  percent  in  2001  and
approximately 4 percent in 2000. Based on forecasts as of December 31, 2002, the
Company  expects  exchange to have a neutral to slightly  positive impact on our
2003 operating results when compared to 2002.

     Exchange  gains  (losses)--net  amounted  to $(118)  million in 2002,  $(9)
million in 2001 and $(12)  million  in 2000 and were  recorded  in Other  Income
(Loss)--Net in our statements of income.  Exchange gains (losses)--net  includes
the  remeasurement  of monetary assets and liabilities  from certain  currencies
into  functional  currencies and the costs of hedging  certain  exposures of our
balance sheet.

Refer to Note 10.

FINANCIAL POSITION

Our balance  sheet as of December 31, 2002,  as compared to our balance sheet as
of December 31, 2001, was significantly impacted by our Company's acquisition of
CCEAG. Prior to consolidation, our investment in CCEAG was recorded as an equity
method   investment.   Thus,   the  $716  million   decrease  in  Equity  Method
Investments-Other,  Principally  Bottling  Companies was primarily driven by the
consolidation of CCEAG.  Upon  consolidation  of CCEAG, the individual  balances
were  included  in the  Company's  respective  balance  sheet  line  items.  The
consolidations  of CCEAG,  CCDA,  CBC and  Odwalla  were the main reason for the
following  changes in the  Company's  balance  sheet from  December  31, 2001 to
December 31, 2002:

(1) $215 million increase in Trade Accounts Receivable;

(2) $239 million increase in Inventories;

(3) $1,458 million increase in Property, Plant and Equipment;

(4) $974 million increase in goodwill, trademarks and other intangible assets;

(5) $1,299 million increase in Other Liabilities.

     Additionally, the asset impairments recorded as a result of the adoption of
SFAS No. 142,  which was effective  January 1, 2002,  also impacted the December
31, 2002 balance sheet,  by reducing the balances in both  investments and Other
Assets and goodwill,  trademarks and other intangible  assets.  Refer to Notes 1
and 4.

     The $1,482 million increase in the Company's Long-Term Debt during 2002 was
primarily due to two factors.  The first factor was the  consolidation of CCEAG,
which had the effect of increasing debt by $843 million as of December 31, 2002,
of which  approximately  $800 million is  classified  as  long-term.  The second
factor was the  issuance  during 2002 of $750 million of notes due June 1, 2005.
The proceeds of this $750 million  long-term  debt  issuance were used to reduce
current debt.


IMPACT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES

Inflation  affects  the way we operate  in many  markets  around  the world.  In
general,  we believe that over time we are able to increase prices to counteract
the majority of the  inflationary  effects of  increasing  costs and to generate
sufficient cash flows to maintain our productive capability.


NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

Effective  January  1, 2002,  our  Company  adopted  the  preferable  fair value
recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 using the modified prospective transition
method  under  the  provisions  of SFAS  No.  148.  Refer to the  above  heading
"Application of Critical Accounting Policies-Stock-Based Compensation" and Notes
1 and 13.

     Effective  January 1, 2002, our Company  adopted SFAS No. 142. Refer to the
above heading "Application of Critical Accounting Policies-Goodwill,  Trademarks
and Other Intangible Assets" and Notes 1 and 4.

     Effective  January 1, 2002, our Company  adopted SFAS No. 144,  "Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived  Assets." This  statement  requires
the following  three-step  approach for assessing and recognizing the impairment
of  long-lived   assets:  (1)  consider  whether  indicators  of  impairment  of
long-lived  assets are present;  (2) if indicators  of  impairment  are present,
determine  whether  the sum of the  estimated  undiscounted  future  cash  flows
attributable to the


                                                         2002 ANNUAL REPORT - 69


<PAGE>


      FINANCIAL REVIEW INCORPORATING MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
                     The Coca-Cola Company and Subsidiaries

assets  in  question  is less  than  their  carrying  amount;  and (3) if  less,
recognize an impairment  loss based on the excess of the carrying  amount of the
assets over their  respective  fair values.  In addition,  SFAS No. 144 provides
more guidance on estimating  cash flows when performing a  recoverability  test,
requires  that a long-lived  asset to be disposed of other than by sale (such as
abandoned)  be  classified  as "held  and used"  until it is  disposed  of,  and
establishes more  restrictive  criteria to classify an asset as "held for sale."
The  adoption  of SFAS No. 144 did not have a material  impact on our  financial
statements  since it  retained  the  fundamental  provisions  of SFAS  No.  121,
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
Be Disposed Of," related to the recognition and measurement of the impairment of
long-lived  assets to be "held and used." However,  we believe SFAS No. 144 is a
statement impacting our critical  accounting  estimates for Other Assets and for
Property,  Plant and  Equipment.  For further  discussion,  refer to the heading
"Application  of  Critical  Accounting  Policies--Recoverability  of  Noncurrent
Assets."

     Effective  January 1, 2002, our Company  adopted the provisions of Emerging
Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 01-9,  "Accounting for Consideration Given by
a Vendor to a Customer or a Reseller of the Vendor's  Products."  EITF Issue No.
01-9 codifies and reconciles the EITF  consensuses on all or specific aspects of
EITF Issues No. 00-14,  "Accounting  for Certain Sales  Incentives,"  No. 00-22,
"Accounting  for 'Points' and Certain  Other  Time-Based or  Volume-Based  Sales
Incentives  Offers,  and Offers for Free Products or Services to be Delivered in
the  Future,"  and No.  00-25,  "Vendor  Income  Statement  Characterization  of
Consideration Paid to a Reseller of the Vendor's Products," and identifies other
related  interpretive  issues.  The types of sales  incentives  provided  by our
Company to bottlers,  resellers, vendors and customers of our Company's products
principally  include  participation in sales promotion programs and volume-based
incentives.  Our Company adopted the provisions of EITF Issues No. 00-14 and No.
00-22 on January 1, 2001, resulting in the income statement  reclassification of
certain sales incentives.  Upon adoption of EITF Issues No. 00-14 and No. 00-22,
the  Company  reduced  both Net  Operating  Revenues  and  Selling,  General and
Administrative  Expenses by approximately  $580 million and $569 million for the
years  ended  December  31,  2001 and 2000,  respectively.  EITF Issue No.  01-9
required  certain  selling  expenses  incurred by the  Company,  not  previously
reclassified,  to be classified as deductions from revenue.  The adoption of the
remaining items included in EITF Issue No. 01-9 resulted in the Company reducing
both Net Operating Revenues and Selling,  General and Administrative Expenses by
approximately  $2.5  billion in each of the years  ended  December  31, 2001 and
2000. These  reclassifications  had no impact on Operating Income. The aggregate
amount of funds  provided by our  Company to  bottlers,  resellers,  vendors and
customers of our Company's products was approximately $3.4 billion, $3.1 billion
and $3.1 billion,  respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and
2000.  The increase in 2002  compared to 2001 was  primarily  due to  structural
changes.

     Our  Company   adopted   the   provisions   of  SFAS  No.  141,   "Business
Combinations," for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. SFAS
No. 141  requires  all business  combinations  to be  accounted  for by a single
method--the purchase method. Furthermore,  SFAS No. 141 requires  recognition of
intangible  assets apart from goodwill if they arise from  contractual  or legal
rights or if they are separable  from  goodwill.  This  statement did not have a
material impact on our financial statements.

     In June  2002,  the  FASB  issued  SFAS  No.  146,  "Accounting  for  Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal  Activities." SFAS No. 146 addresses  financial
accounting and reporting for costs  associated with exit or disposal  activities
and nullifies EITF Issue No. 94-3,  "Liability  Recognition for Certain Employee
Termination  Benefits  and Other  Costs to Exit an Activity  (including  Certain
Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)."  SFAS No. 146 requires that a liability for
a cost  associated  with an exit or  disposal  activity be  recognized  when the
liability is incurred.  Under EITF Issue No. 94-3, a liability  for an exit cost
as defined was recognized at the date of an entity's commitment to an exit plan.
SFAS No. 146 also  establishes  that fair  value is the  objective  for  initial
measurement  of the  liability.  SFAS No. 146 is effective for exit and disposal
activities  that are initiated  after  December 31, 2002.  This  statement  will
impact the timing of our  recognition of liabilities  for costs  associated with
exit or disposal activities.

     Effective  January 1, 2001, the Company  adopted SFAS No. 133,  "Accounting
for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging  Activities," as amended by SFAS No. 137
and SFAS No. 138. As discussed further in Note 10, the 2002 and 2001

financial statements were prepared in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.
133.  Prior  years'  financial  statements  have  not  been  restated.  The 2000
financial   statements   were  prepared  in  accordance   with  the   applicable
professional  literature for  derivatives  and hedging  instruments in effect at
that time.

     In November  2002,  the FASB  issued  Interpretation  No. 45,  "Guarantor's
Accounting  and  Disclosure  Requirements  for  Guarantees,  Including  Indirect
Guarantees of  Indebtedness  of Others." This  interpretation  elaborates on the
disclosures to be made by a guarantor in interim and annual financial statements
about  the  obligations  under  certain  guarantees.  Our  Company  adopted  the
disclosure  provisions  of FASB  Interpretation  No. 45 as of December 31, 2002.
FASB  Interpretation  No. 45 also  clarifies  that a  guarantor  is  required to
recognize,  at the  inception of a guarantee,  a liability for the fair value of
the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee.  The initial recognition and
initial  measurement  provisions  of this  interpretation  are  applicable  on a
prospective  basis to guarantees  issued or modified after December 31, 2002. We
do not currently provide significant guarantees on a routine basis. As a result,
we do not currently believe this  interpretation  will have a material impact on
our financial  statements.  To the extent that our Company  enters into any such
guarantees after December 31, 2002, we will record the fair value as an expense.

     In January 2003, the FASB issued  Interpretation No. 46,  "Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities." This interpretation  addresses the consolidation of
business  enterprises  (variable interest entities) to which the usual condition
of  consolidation  does not apply.  This  interpretation  focuses  on  financial
interests  that  indicate  control.  It  concludes  that in the absence of clear
control through voting interests,  a company's exposure  (variable  interest) to
the economic  risks and potential  rewards from the variable  interest  entity's
assets and activities are the best evidence of control.  Variable  interests are
rights and obligations  that convey economic gains or losses from changes in the
values of the  variable  interest  entity's  assets  and  liabilities.  Variable
interests may arise from financial  instruments,  service  contracts,  nonvoting
ownership interests and other arrangements. If an enterprise holds a majority of
the  variable  interests  of an  entity,  it would  be  considered  the  primary
beneficiary.  The  primary  beneficiary  would be  required  to include  assets,
liabilities and the results of operations of the variable interest entity in its
consolidated  financial statements.  This interpretation  applies immediately to
variable  interest  entities  which are  created  after or for which  control is
obtained after January 31, 2003. For variable interest entities created prior to
February 1, 2003, the provisions would be applied  effective July 1, 2003. Refer
to  the  heading  "Off-Balance  Sheet  Arrangements  and  Aggregate  Contractual
Obligations."


FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Certain written and oral statements made by our Company and subsidiaries or with
the approval of an authorized  executive  officer of our Company may  constitute
"forward-looking statements" as defined under the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995,  including  statements made in this report and other filings
with the Securities and Exchange  Commission.  Generally,  the words  "believe,"
"expect,"  "intend,"  "estimate,"  "anticipate,"  "project,"  "will" and similar
expressions  identify  forward-looking  statements,   which  generally  are  not
historical in nature. All statements which address operating performance, events
or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future--including
statements  relating to volume  growth,  share of sales and  earnings  per share
growth  and  statements  expressing  general  optimism  about  future  operating
results--are forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements are subject
to certain  risks and  uncertainties  that could cause actual  results to differ
materially from our Company's historical experience and our present expectations
or projections. As and when made, management believes that these forward-looking
statements are reasonable.  However,  caution should be taken not to place undue
reliance on any such forward-looking statements since such statements speak only
as of the date when made.  The  Company  undertakes  no  obligation  to publicly
update or revise  any  forward-looking  statements,  whether  as a result of new
information, future events or otherwise.

      FINANCIAL REVIEW INCORPORATING MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
                     The Coca-Cola Company and Subsidiaries

     The following are some of the factors that could cause our Company's actual
results  to  differ  materially  from  the  expected  results  described  in  or
underlying our Company's forward-looking statements:

- -  Economic and  political  conditions,  especially  in  international  markets,
   including  civil  unrest,   product   boycotts,   governmental   changes  and
   restrictions  on the  ability to transfer  capital  across  borders.  Without
   limiting the preceding sentence,  the current unstable economic and political
   conditions  and civil unrest in the Middle East and  Venezuela,  potential or
   actual  conflicts in Iraq,  North Korea or elsewhere,  or the continuation or
   escalation of terrorism, could have adverse impacts on our Company's business
   results  or  financial  condition.

- -  Changes in the nonalcoholic  beverages business  environment.  These include,
   without limitation, changes in consumer preferences,  competitive product and
   pricing  pressures and our ability to gain or maintain  share of sales in the
   global  market as a result of actions by  competitors.  Factors such as these
   could impact our earnings, share of sales and volume growth.

- -  Foreign  currency rate  fluctuations,  interest rate  fluctuations  and other
   capital  market  conditions.  Most  of  our  exposures  to  capital  markets,
   including  foreign currency and interest rates, are managed on a consolidated
   basis,  which allows us to net certain exposures and, thus, take advantage of
   any natural offsets.  We use derivative  financial  instruments to reduce our
   net exposure to financial risks. There can be no assurance, however, that our
   financial  risk  management  program will be successful  in reducing  capital
   market exposures.

- -  Adverse weather conditions, which could reduce demand for Company products.

- -  The effectiveness of our advertising, marketing and promotional programs.

- -  Fluctuations in the cost and availability of raw materials and the ability to
   maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships.

- -  Our  ability to achieve  earnings  forecasts,  which are  generated  based on
   projected  volumes and sales of many  product  types,  some of which are more
   profitable  than others.  There can be no assurance  that we will achieve the
   projected level or mix of product sales.

- -  Changes in laws and regulations,  including changes in accounting  standards,
   taxation  requirements  (including tax rate changes, new tax laws and revised
   tax law interpretations), competition laws and environmental laws in domestic
   or foreign jurisdictions.

- -  Our ability to penetrate developing and emerging markets,  which also depends
   on economic and political conditions,  and how well we are able to acquire or
   form  strategic  business  alliances  with local  bottlers and make necessary
   infrastructure enhancements to production facilities,  distribution networks,
   sales  equipment  and  technology.   Moreover,  the  supply  of  products  in
   developing  markets must match the customers' demand for those products,  and
   due to product, price and cultural differences,  there can be no assurance of
   product acceptance in any particular market.

- -  The  uncertainties  of litigation,  as well as other risks and  uncertainties
   detailed  from  time  to  time  in  our  Company's  Securities  and  Exchange
   Commission filings.

     The foregoing list of important factors is not exclusive.

<PAGE>

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                     The Coca-Cola Company and Subsidiaries

NOTE 1: ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Organization
- ------------
The Coca-Cola Company is predominantly a manufacturer,  distributor and marketer
of nonalcoholic  beverage concentrates and syrups. When used in these notes, the
terms  "Company,"  "we,"  "us" or  "our"  mean  The  Coca-Cola  Company  and its
divisions and subsidiaries.  Operating in more than 200 countries worldwide,  we
primarily sell our concentrates and syrups, as well as some finished  beverages,
to bottling  and canning  operations,  distributors,  fountain  wholesalers  and
fountain  retailers.  We also market and distribute  juices and juice drinks and
certain water products.  Additionally,  we have ownership  interests in bottling
and canning operations.  We have significant markets for our products in all the
world's geographic regions.

Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
- ---------------------------------------
Our Consolidated  Financial  Statements  include the accounts of our Company and
all subsidiaries.  We consolidate all entities that our Company controls.  Under
current  accounting  guidance,  our  Company  is not  permitted  to  consolidate
companies  we do not  control.  We use the  equity  method  to  account  for our
investments  in companies  in which we have the ability to exercise  significant
influence  over  operating  and  financial  policies.  Consolidated  net  income
includes  our  Company's  share  of the net  earnings  of these  companies.  The
difference between consolidation and the equity method impacts certain financial
ratios  because of the  presentation  of the detailed line items reported in the
financial statements.  We account for our investments in other companies that we
do not control and for which we do not have the ability to exercise  significant
influence under the cost method. In accordance with the cost method,  the assets
are recorded at cost or fair value, as appropriate.  Our Company eliminates from
our  financial  results all  significant  intercompany  transactions,  including
transactions with equity method investees.

Certain amounts in the prior years' financial  statements have been reclassified
to conform to the current year presentation.

Revenue Recognition
- -------------------
Our Company  recognizes revenue when title of our products is transferred to our
bottling partners or our customers.

Advertising Costs
- -----------------
Our Company  expenses  production  costs of print,  radio,  television and other
advertisements as of the first date the advertisements  take place.  Advertising
expenses included in Selling,  General and  Administrative  Expenses were $1,775
million  in 2002,  $1,970  million in 2001 and  $1,655  million  in 2000.  As of
December 31, 2002 and 2001,  advertising  production costs of approximately $170
million and $142  million,  respectively,  were  recorded  primarily  in Prepaid
Expenses and Other Assets and noncurrent Other Assets in our balance sheets.

Stock-Based Compensation
- ------------------------
Our Company  currently  sponsors stock option plans and  restricted  stock award
plans.  Refer to Note 13. Prior to 2002,  our Company  accounted for those plans
under  the  recognition  and  measurement  provisions  of APB  Opinion  No.  25,
"Accounting   for  Stock  Issued  to   Employees"   (APB  No.  25)  and  related
interpretations.  No stock-based employee compensation expense for stock options
was  reflected in net income for the years ended  December 31, 2001 and 2000, as
all stock options  granted under those plans had an exercise  price equal to the
fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Effective
January 1, 2002,  our Company  adopted  the  preferable  fair value  recognition
provisions  of  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  (SFAS) No. 123,
"Accounting for  Stock-Based  Compensation."  Our Company  selected the modified
prospective  method of  adoption  described  in SFAS No.  148,  "Accounting  for
Stock-Based   Compensation-Transition   and   Disclosure."   Compensation   cost
recognized in 2002 is the same as that which would have been  recognized had the
fair value method of SFAS No. 123 been applied from its original effective date.
In  accordance  with the modified  prospective  method of adoption,  results for
prior years have not been restated.



                                                         2002 ANNUAL REPORT - 77

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Issuances of Stock by Equity Investees
- --------------------------------------
When one of our equity investees issues additional shares to third parties,  our
percentage  ownership  interest  in the  investee  decreases.  In the  event the
issuance  price per share is more or less than our average  carrying  amount per
share, we recognize a noncash gain or loss on the issuance. This noncash gain or
loss, net of any deferred  taxes,  is generally  recognized in our net income in
the period the change of ownership interest occurs.

     If  gains  have  been  previously  recognized  on  issuances  of an  equity
investee's stock and shares of the equity investee are subsequently  repurchased
by the equity investee,  gain recognition does not occur on issuances subsequent
to the  date  of a  repurchase  until  shares  have  been  issued  in an  amount
equivalent to the number of  repurchased  shares.  This type of  transaction  is
reflected  as an equity  transaction,  and the net  effect is  reflected  in our
balance sheets. Refer to Note 3.

Net Income Per Share
- --------------------
We  compute   basic  net  income  per  share  by  dividing  net  income  by  the
weighted-average  number of shares  outstanding.  Diluted  net  income per share
includes the dilutive effect of stock-based compensation awards, if any.

Cash Equivalents
- ----------------
We classify marketable  securities that are highly liquid and have maturities of
three months or less at the date of purchase as cash equivalents.

Inventories
- -----------
Inventories  consist  primarily of raw  materials and supplies and are valued at
the lower of cost or  market.  In  general,  we  determine  cost on the basis of
average cost or first-in, first-out methods.

Recoverability of Investments
- -----------------------------
Management   periodically   assesses  the   recoverability   of  our   Company's
investments.  For publicly traded  investments,  readily available quoted market
prices are an  indication of the fair value of our  Company's  investments.  For
non-publicly  traded  investments,  management  assesses  fair  value  based  on
valuation  methodologies,  as  appropriate,  including  discounted  cash  flows,
estimates  of sales  proceeds  and  external  appraisals.  If an  investment  is
considered to be impaired and the decline in value is other than  temporary,  we
record an appropriate write-down.

Other Assets
- ------------
Our  Company  advances  payments  to certain  customers  for  marketing  to fund
activities  intended to generate  profitable  volume.  Advance payments are also
made to certain  customers for distribution  rights.  Additionally,  our Company
invests in  infrastructure  programs  with our  bottlers  that are  directed  at
strengthening  our bottling system and increasing  unit case volume.  Management
periodically evaluates the recoverability of these assets by preparing estimates
of sales volume, the resulting gross profit,  cash flows and other factors.  The
costs of these  programs are  recorded in Prepaid  Expenses and Other Assets and
noncurrent  Other Assets and are  subsequently  amortized over the periods to be
directly benefited.  Amortization  expense for infrastructure  programs was $176
million,  $222  million  and $275  million,  respectively,  for the years  ended
December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. Refer to Note 2.

                     The Coca-Cola Company and Subsidiaries

Property, Plant and Equipment
- -----------------------------
We state  Property,  Plant and  Equipment  at cost and  depreciate  such  assets
principally by the  straight-line  method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets.  Management  assesses  the  recoverability  of the  carrying  amount  of
Property,  Plant and  Equipment if certain  events or changes  occur,  such as a
significant  decrease in market value of the assets or a  significant  change in
the business climate in a particular market.

Goodwill, Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets
- ------------------------------------------------
Effective January 1, 2002, our Company adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other
Intangible  Assets." The adoption of SFAS No. 142 required an initial impairment
assessment involving a comparison of the fair value of goodwill,  trademarks and
other intangible assets to current carrying value. Upon adoption,  we recorded a
loss for the  cumulative  effect of  accounting  change for SFAS No. 142, net of
income taxes, of $367 million for Company operations and $559 million for equity
investees.  We did not restate  prior  periods for the adoption of SFAS No. 142.
Trademarks and other  intangible  assets  determined to have  indefinite  useful
lives are not amortized.  We test such  trademarks and other  intangible  assets
with  indefinite  useful lives for  impairment  annually or more  frequently  if
events or circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. Trademarks and
other  intangible  assets  determined to have definite  lives are amortized over
their useful lives. We review such trademarks and other  intangible  assets with
definite  lives  for  impairment  to  ensure  they are  appropriately  valued if
conditions  exist that may indicate the carrying  value may not be  recoverable.
Such  conditions  may include an economic  downturn in a geographic  market or a
change in the assessment of future  operations.  Goodwill is not  amortized.  We
perform tests for impairment of goodwill  annually or more  frequently if events
or circumstances indicate it might be impaired. Such tests include comparing the
fair value of a reporting  unit with its  carrying  value,  including  goodwill.
Impairment assessments are performed using a variety of methodologies, including
cash flow  analysis,  estimates of sales  proceeds and  independent  appraisals.
Where applicable,  an appropriate  discount rate is used, based on the Company's
cost of capital rate or location-specific economic factors. Refer to Note 4.

Retirement Related Benefits
- ---------------------------
Using  appropriate  actuarial  methods and  assumptions,  our Company's  defined
benefit  pension  plans  are  accounted  for in  accordance  with  SFAS No.  87,
"Employers' Accounting for Pensions." Our nonpension postretirement benefits are
accounted  for in  accordance  with SFAS No.  106,  "Employers'  Accounting  for
Postretirement  Benefits Other Than Pensions." One of the principal  assumptions
used to calculate net periodic  pension cost is the expected  long-term  rate of
return on plan assets. The required use of the expected long-term rate of return
on plan assets may result in  recognized  returns  that are greater or less than
the actual returns on those plan assets in any given year.  Over time,  however,
the expected  long-term rate of return on plan assets is designed to approximate
the actual long-term returns.

     Our Company uses long-term historical actual return information, the mix of
investments  that  comprise  plan  assets,  and future  estimates  of  long-term
investment returns by reference to external sources to develop our assumption of
the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.

     The discount rate  assumptions  used to account for pension and  nonpension
postretirement  benefit  plans  reflect  the rates  available  on  high-quality,
fixed-income  debt  instruments  on  December  31 of  each  year.  The  rate  of
compensation  increase  is  another  significant  assumption  used  for  pension
accounting and is determined by the Company based upon annual reviews.

     For  postretirement  health  care  plan  accounting,  our  Company  reviews
external data and our own  historical  trends for health care costs to determine
the health care cost trend rate assumptions.

     Refer to Note 14.

Contingencies
- -------------
Our Company is involved in various legal proceedings.  Due to their nature, such
legal proceedings involve inherent uncertainties  including, but not limited to,
court  rulings,   negotiations   between   affected   parties  and  governmental
intervention. Management assesses the probability of loss for such contingencies
and  accrues  a  liability  and/or  discloses  the  relevant  circumstances,  as
appropriate. Refer to Note 11.

Use of Estimates
- ----------------
In conformity with generally accepted accounting principles,  the preparation of
our  financial   statements  requires  our  management  to  make  estimates  and
assumptions  that affect the reported amounts of assets,  liabilities,  revenues
and expenses and the  disclosure of  contingent  assets and  liabilities  in our
financial statements and accompanying notes.  Although these estimates are based
on our  knowledge of current  events and actions we may undertake in the future,
actual results may ultimately differ from estimates.

New Accounting Standards
- ------------------------
As previously  mentioned,  effective  January 1, 2002,  our Company  adopted the
preferable fair value recognition  provisions of SFAS No. 123 using the modified
prospective  transition  method under the  provisions of SFAS No. 148.  Refer to
Note 13.

     As previously  mentioned,  effective  January 1, 2002, our Company  adopted
SFAS No. 142. Refer to Note 4.

     Effective  January 1, 2002, our Company  adopted SFAS No. 144,  "Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived  Assets." This  statement  requires
the following  three-step  approach for assessing and recognizing the impairment
of  long-lived   assets:  (1)  consider  whether  indicators  of  impairment  of
long-lived  assets are present;  (2) if indicators  of  impairment  are present,
determine  whether  the sum of the  estimated  undiscounted  future  cash  flows
attributable to the assets in question is less than their carrying  amount;  and
(3) if less,  recognize an  impairment  loss based on the excess of the carrying
amounts of the assets over their respective fair values.  In addition,  SFAS No.
144  provides  more  guidance  on  estimating   cash  flows  when  performing  a
recoverability  test,  requires that a long-lived  asset to be disposed of other
than by sale (such as  abandoned)  be  classified as "held and used" until it is
disposed of, and establishes more  restrictive  criteria to classify an asset as
"held for sale." The adoption of SFAS No. 144 did not have a material  impact on
our financial  statements  since it retained the fundamental  provisions of SFAS
No. 121,  "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to Be Disposed Of," related to the  recognition  and  measurement  of the
impairment of long-lived assets to be "held and used."

     Effective  January 1, 2002, our Company  adopted the provisions of Emerging
Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 01-9,  "Accounting for Consideration Given by
a Vendor to a Customer or a Reseller of the Vendor's  Products."  EITF Issue No.
01-9 codifies and reconciles the EITF  consensuses on all or specific aspects of
EITF Issues No. 00-14,  "Accounting  for Certain Sales  Incentives,"  No. 00-22,
"Accounting  for 'Points' and Certain  Other  Time-Based or  Volume-Based  Sales
Incentives  Offers,  and Offers for Free Products or Services to be Delivered in
the  Future,"  and No.  00-25,  "Vendor  Income  Statement  Characterization  of
Consideration Paid to a Reseller of the Vendor's Products," and identifies other
related  interpretive  issues.  The types of sales  incentives  provided  by our
Company to bottlers,  resellers, vendors and customers of our Company's products
principally  include  participation in sales promotion programs and volume-based
incentives.  Our Company adopted the provisions of EITF Issues No. 00-14 and No.
00-22 on January 1, 2001, resulting in the income statement  reclassification of
certain sales incentives.  Upon adoption of EITF Issues No. 00-14 and No. 00-22,
the  Company  reduced  both Net  Operating  Revenues  and  Selling,  General and
Administrative  Expenses by approximately  $580 million and $569 million for the
years  ended  December  31,  2001 and 2000,  respectively.  EITF Issue No.  01-9
required  certain  selling  expenses  incurred by the  Company,  not  previously
reclassified,  to be classified as deductions from revenue.  The adoption of the
remaining items included in EITF Issue No. 01-9 resulted in the Company reducing
both Net Operating Revenues and Selling,  General and Administrative Expenses by
approximately  $2.5  billion in each of the years  ended  December  31, 2001 and
2000. These reclassifications had no impact on Operating Income.

     Our  Company   adopted   the   provisions   of  SFAS  No.  141,   "Business
Combinations," for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. SFAS
No. 141  requires  all business  combinations  to be  accounted  for by a single
method-the purchase method.  Furthermore,  SFAS No. 141 requires  recognition of
intangible  assets apart from goodwill if they arise from  contractual  or legal
rights or if they are separable  from  goodwill.  This  statement did not have a
material impact on our financial statements.

                     The Coca-Cola Company and Subsidiaries

     In June 2002, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS
No. 146,  "Accounting for Costs  Associated  with Exit or Disposal  Activities."
SFAS No. 146 addresses  financial  accounting and reporting for costs associated
with exit or disposal  activities and nullifies EITF Issue No. 94-3,  "Liability
Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an
Activity  (including Certain Costs Incurred in a  Restructuring)."  SFAS No. 146
requires  that a  liability  for a cost  associated  with an  exit  or  disposal
activity be  recognized  when the  liability is  incurred.  Under EITF Issue No.
94-3, a liability  for an exit cost as defined was  recognized at the date of an
entity's  commitment to an exit plan.  SFAS No. 146 also  establishes  that fair
value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability. SFAS No. 146 is
effective for exit and disposal activities that are initiated after December 31,
2002.  This statement  will impact the timing of our  recognition of liabilities
for costs associated with exit or disposal activities.

     Effective  January 1, 2001, the Company  adopted SFAS No. 133,  "Accounting
for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging  Activities," as amended by SFAS No. 137
and  SFAS  No.  138.  As  discussed  further  in Note  10,  the  2002  and  2001
Consolidated   Financial   Statements  were  prepared  in  accordance  with  the
provisions  of SFAS No. 133.  Prior years'  financial  statements  have not been
restated.  The 2000 financial  statements  were prepared in accordance  with the
applicable  professional  literature for derivatives and hedging  instruments in
effect at that time.

     In November  2002,  the FASB  issued  Interpretation  No. 45,  "Guarantor's
Accounting  and  Disclosure  Requirements  for  Guarantees,  Including  Indirect
Guarantees of  Indebtedness  of Others." This  interpretation  elaborates on the
disclosures to be made by a guarantor in interim and annual financial statements
about  the  obligations  under  certain  guarantees.  Our  Company  adopted  the
disclosure  provisions  of FASB  Interpretation  No. 45 as of December 31, 2002.
FASB  Interpretation  No. 45 also  clarifies  that a  guarantor  is  required to
recognize,  at the  inception of a guarantee,  a liability for the fair value of
the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee.  The initial recognition and
initial  measurement  provisions  of this  interpretation  are  applicable  on a
prospective  basis to guarantees  issued or modified after December 31, 2002. We
do not currently provide significant guarantees on a routine basis. As a result,
we do not currently believe this  interpretation  will have a material impact on
our financial  statements.  To the extent that our Company  enters into any such
guarantees after December 31, 2002, we will record the fair value as an expense.

     In January 2003, the FASB issued  Interpretation No. 46,  "Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities." This interpretation  addresses the consolidation of
business  enterprises  (variable interest entities) to which the usual condition
of  consolidation  does not apply.  This  interpretation  focuses  on  financial
interests  that  indicate  control.  It  concludes  that in the absence of clear
control through voting interests,  a company's exposure  (variable  interest) to
the economic  risks and potential  rewards from the variable  interest  entity's
assets and activities are the best evidence of control.  Variable  interests are
rights and obligations  that convey economic gains or losses from changes in the
values of the  variable  interest  entity's  assets  and  liabilities.  Variable
interests may arise from financial  instruments,  service  contracts,  nonvoting
ownership interests and other arrangements. If an enterprise holds a majority of
the  variable  interests  of an  entity,  it would  be  considered  the  primary
beneficiary.  The  primary  beneficiary  would be  required  to include  assets,
liabilities and the results of operations of the variable interest entity in its
financial  statements.  This  interpretation  applies  immediately  to  variable
interest  entities that are created after or for which control is obtained after
January 31, 2003. For variable  interest  entities  created prior to February 1,
2003, the provisions would be applied effective July 1, 2003.

     Our Company has equity  ownership  interests in bottlers  that we currently
account for under the equity method of  accounting.  For certain  bottlers,  our
Company holds variable interests such as providing financing and guarantees,  in
addition  to  our  equity  investments.  As a  result,  these  bottlers  may  be
considered  variable interest entities,  and it is reasonably  possible that the
Company may be required to consolidate such variable interest entities when FASB
Interpretation  No. 46 becomes effective on July 1, 2003. The difference between
consolidation  and the equity method impacts certain financial ratios because of
the   presentation  of  the  detailed  line  items  reported  in  the  financial
statements.   However,   consolidated   net   income  for  the  period  and  our
share-owners'  equity  at  the  end of the  period  are  the  same  whether  the
investment  in the  company  is  accounted  for under the  equity  method or the
company is consolidated. We do not expect this interpretation to have a material
impact on our financial statements.

Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc.
- --------------------------
Coca-Cola  Enterprises  Inc.  (Coca-Cola  Enterprises) is the largest  marketer,
distributor  and producer of bottle and can liquid  nonalcoholic  refreshment in
the world, operating in eight countries. On December 31, 2002, our Company owned
approximately   38  percent  of  the  outstanding   common  stock  of  Coca-Cola
Enterprises, and accordingly, we account for our investment by the equity method
of  accounting.  As of December 31,  2002,  our  proportionate  share of the net
assets of Coca-Cola  Enterprises  exceeded our investment by approximately  $285
million.

     Our net  concentrate  and syrup sales to  Coca-Cola  Enterprises  were $4.3
billion  in 2002,  $3.9  billion  in 2001 and $3.5  billion  in 2000.  Coca-Cola
Enterprises   purchases  sweeteners  through  our  Company;   however,   related
collections  from  Coca-Cola  Enterprises  and  payments  to  suppliers  are not
included  in our  statements  of income.  These  transactions  amounted  to $325
million in 2002,  $295 million in 2001 and $298 million in 2000. We also provide
certain  administrative  and  other  services  to  Coca-Cola  Enterprises  under
negotiated fee arrangements.

     Cash payments made by us directly to Coca-Cola  Enterprises  for support of
certain  marketing  activities  and our  participation  with them in cooperative
advertising and other marketing programs amounted to approximately $837 million,
$606  million  and $533  million  in 2002,  2001 and  2000,  respectively.  Cash
payments made by us directly to Coca-Cola  Enterprises' customers for support of
certain  marketing  activities  and  programs  amounted  to  approximately  $204
million,  $282  million and $221 million in 2002,  2001 and 2000,  respectively.
Pursuant  to  cooperative   advertising  and  trade  agreements  with  Coca-Cola
Enterprises,  we received  approximately  $264  million,  $252  million and $195
million in 2002,  2001 and 2000,  respectively,  from Coca-Cola  Enterprises for
local media and marketing program expense reimbursements.

     In  early  2002,  our  Company  entered  into  a  multi-year  Sales  Growth
Initiative  (SGI)  agreement  with Coca-Cola  Enterprises to support  profitable
growth of our  brands  in their  territories.  Total  cash  support  paid by our
Company  under  the SGI  agreement  in 2002 was $150  million.  This  amount  is
included  in  the  total  support  of  certain  marketing   activities  and  our
participation  with them in cooperative  marketing and other marketing  programs
noted above.

     The entire SGI agreement may be terminated by either party by providing six
months written notice to the other party; provided, however, that once an annual
plan has been  agreed  upon by both  companies,  such  termination  shall not be
effective  until the end of the  applicable  plan year. In addition,  during the
first three quarters of any year,  either party may cancel for ensuing  quarters
the sales volume  growth  targets and cash  support  funding  provisions  of the
agreement  for that year by  providing  10 days' notice prior to the end of such
quarter. Upon such quarterly cancellation, all other provisions of the agreement
will remain in full force and effect. Volume growth funding is paid to Coca-Cola
Enterprises  equally  over the four  quarters of the program year within 30 days
after the  beginning of each quarter.  Our Company  recognizes a charge as sales
volume growth is attained by Coca-Cola Enterprises. Such amounts are included as
allowance deductions in Net Operating Revenues.

     The agreement  provides for refunds of funding  advances  should  Coca-Cola
Enterprises  fail to attain  specified  minimum  sales  volume  growth  targets.
Accordingly,

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                     The Coca-Cola Company and Subsidiaries

should  Coca-Cola  Enterprises not attain  specified  minimum  cumulative  sales
volume  growth  targets  in  the  ensuing  quarters  of a  given  year,  amounts
recognized to date for that year would be subject to refund.

     Our Company recently agreed with Coca-Cola  Enterprises to modify the terms
of the SGI agreement  relating to 2003 and beyond.  Under the amended agreement,
funding for 2003,  anticipated to be $250 million under the original  agreement,
will  decrease  to  $200  million.  The  new  amendment,  however,  requires  an
additional $275 million in funding to Coca-Cola  Enterprises  over the next nine
years  (2003-2011) and  significantly  reduces the annual  reductions in funding
that were a part of the original agreement.  In addition, the amendment provides
for each  company to retain all cost  savings it  generates  from future  system
efficiency  initiatives.  The  previous  agreement  called for an equal  sharing
between our Company and Coca-Cola  Enterprises  of combined  proceeds  above set
targets.

     Our Company  previously  entered into programs with  Coca-Cola  Enterprises
designed to help it develop cold-drink infrastructure. Under these programs, our
Company paid Coca-Cola  Enterprises  for a portion of the cost of developing the
infrastructure   necessary  to  support  accelerated  placements  of  cold-drink
equipment.  These  payments  support a common  objective of  increased  sales of
Coca-Cola   beverages  from  increased   availability  and  consumption  in  the
cold-drink  channel.  In connection with these programs,  Coca-Cola  Enterprises
agrees to:

(1)  purchase  and place  specified  numbers of  venders/coolers  or  cold-drink
     equipment each year through 2008;

(2)  maintain the equipment in service, with certain exceptions, for a period of
     at least 12 years after placement;

(3)  maintain and stock the equipment in accordance  with  specified  standards;
     and

(4)  report  to our  Company  minimum  average  annual  unit case  sales  volume
     throughout the economic life of the equipment.

     Coca-Cola  Enterprises  must achieve minimum average unit case sales volume
for a 12-year period following the placement of equipment. These minimum average
unit case  sales  volume  levels  ensure  adequate  gross  profit  from sales of
concentrate  to  fully  recover  the  capitalized  costs  plus a  return  on the
Company's  investment.   Should  Coca-Cola  Enterprises  fail  to  purchase  the
specified numbers of  venders/coolers  or cold-drink  equipment for any calendar
year through 2008, the parties agree to mutually develop a reasonable  solution.
Should no  mutually  agreeable  solution  be  developed,  or in the  event  that
Coca-Cola  Enterprises  otherwise  breaches  any material  obligation  under the
contracts and such breach is not remedied within a stated period, then Coca-Cola
Enterprises  would be  required  to repay a portion  of the  support  funding as
determined by our Company. No repayments by Coca-Cola Enterprises have ever been
made under these programs. Our Company paid or committed to pay approximately $3
million  in 2002,  $159  million in 2001 and $223  million in 2000 to  Coca-Cola
Enterprises in connection with these infrastructure programs. These payments are
recorded in Prepaid  Expenses and Other Assets and  noncurrent  Other Assets and
amortized  as  deductions  in Net  Operating  Revenues  over the 10-year  period
following  the  placement  of the  equipment.  Our  carrying  values  for  these
infrastructure  programs with  Coca-Cola  Enterprises  were  approximately  $879
million as of  December  31,  2002 and $931  million as of  December  31,  2001.
Effective  2002 and  thereafter,  the Company has no further  commitments  under
these programs.

     As of  January  1,  2001,  Coca-Cola  Enterprises  changed  its  method  of
accounting for  infrastructure  development  payments received from the Company.
Prior to this change, Coca-Cola Enterprises recognized these payments as offsets
to  incremental  expenses  of the  programs  in the  periods  in which they were
incurred.  Coca-Cola  Enterprises now recognizes the infrastructure  development
payments  received  from the  Company  as  income  when  obligations  under  the
contracts are performed.  Because the Company eliminates the financial effect of
significant intercompany transactions (including transactions with equity method
investees),  this  change in  accounting  method had no impact on the  financial
statements of our Company.

     If valued at the  December  31,  2002  quoted  closing  price of  Coca-Cola
Enterprises  shares,  the  value  of our  investment  in  Coca-Cola  Enterprises
exceeded our carrying value by approximately $2.7 billion.

Equity investments include nonbottling investees.

(1) 2001 and 2000 Net Operating Revenues and Gross Profit have been reduced for
  the impact of adopting EITF Issue No. 01-9.

(2) Accounting change is the adoption of SFAS No. 142.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Net sales to equity  investees other than Coca-Cola  Enterprises  were $3.2
billion in 2002,  $3.7 billion in 2001 and $3.5 billion in 2000.  Total  support
payments,  primarily  marketing,  made to equity  investees other than Coca-Cola
Enterprises,  the majority of which are located outside the United States,  were
approximately  $488  million,  $636 million and $663 million for 2002,  2001 and
2000, respectively.

     Effective   February  2002,  our  Company  acquired  control  of  Coca-Cola
Erfrischungsgetraenke  AG  (CCEAG),  the largest  bottler in  Germany.  Prior to
acquiring  control,  our Company  accounted for CCEAG under the equity method of
accounting. Refer to Note 18.

     In the first quarter of 2002,  our Company sold our bottling  operations in
the Baltics to Coca-Cola  Hellenic Bottling Company S.A.  (CCHBC).  The proceeds
from the sale of the Baltics bottlers were  approximately  equal to the carrying
value of the investment.

     In February  2001,  the Company  reached an agreement  with  Carlsberg  A/S
(Carlsberg)  for the  dissolution of Coca-Cola  Nordic  Beverages A/S (CCNB),  a
joint venture bottler in which our Company had a 49 percent  ownership.  In July
2001, our Company and San Miguel  Corporation  (San Miguel)  acquired  Coca-Cola
Bottlers  Philippines,  Inc.  (CCBPI) from Coca-Cola  Amatil Limited  (Coca-Cola
Amatil). Refer to Note 18.

     In November 2001, our Company sold nearly all of its ownership interests in
various Russian bottling  operations to CCHBC for approximately  $170 million in
cash and notes  receivable,  of which $146 million in notes receivable  remained
outstanding as of December 31, 2001. Such amount was  subsequently  collected in
2002. These interests  consisted of the Company's 40 percent ownership  interest
in a joint venture with CCHBC that operates bottling  territories in Siberia and
parts  of  western  Russia,  together  with our  Company's  nearly  100  percent
interests in bottling  operations  with  territories  covering the  remainder of
Russia.

     In July 2000, a merger of Coca-Cola Beverages plc (Coca-Cola Beverages) and
Hellenic  Bottling  Company S.A.  was  completed  to create  CCHBC.  This merger
resulted  in  a  decrease  in  our  Company's  equity  ownership  interest  from
approximately  51 percent of Coca-Cola  Beverages to approximately 24 percent of
the combined entity, CCHBC.

     If valued at the December 31, 2002 quoted closing prices of shares actively
traded  on stock  markets,  the  value of our  investments  in  publicly  traded
bottlers  other  than  Coca-Cola  Enterprises  exceeded  our  carrying  value by
approximately $810 million.


NOTE 3: ISSUANCES OF STOCK BY EQUITY INVESTEE

In  July  2001,  Coca-Cola   Enterprises  completed  its  acquisition  of  Hondo
Incorporated and Herbco Enterprises, Inc., collectively known as Herb Coca-Cola.
The transaction was valued at approximately $1.4 billion,  with approximately 30
percent of the transaction  funded with the issuance of approximately 25 million
shares of Coca-Cola  Enterprises  common stock and the remaining  portion funded
through debt and assumed debt. The Coca-Cola Enterprises common stock issued was
valued in an amount  greater than the book value per share of our  investment in
Coca-Cola Enterprises.  The shares issued,  combined with other share issuances,
exceeded the amount of repurchased  shares under  Coca-Cola  Enterprises'  share
repurchase plan. As a result, the issuance of these shares resulted in a noncash
pretax gain for our Company of

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                     The Coca-Cola Company and Subsidiaries

approximately  $91 million.  We provided  deferred  taxes of  approximately  $36
million on this gain.  This  transaction  reduced  our  ownership  in  Coca-Cola
Enterprises from approximately 40 percent to approximately 38 percent.  No gains
or losses on issuances of stock by equity  investees  were recorded  during 2002
and 2000.

NOTE 4: GOODWILL, TRADEMARKS AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets
are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment. Our Company is
the owner of some of the world's most valuable trademarks.  As a result, certain
trademarks  and  franchise  rights to bottle  and  distribute  such  trademarked
products are expected to generate positive cash flows for as long as the Company
owns such trademarks and franchise rights for a particular territory.  Given the
Company's  more than  100-year  history,  certain  trademarks  and the franchise
rights to bottle and distribute products under our trademarks have been assigned
indefinite  lives.  Intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are
amortized over their useful lives. The  amortization  provisions of SFAS No. 142
apply to goodwill and  intangible  assets  acquired  after June 30,  2001.  With
respect to goodwill and  intangible  assets  acquired prior to July 1, 2001, the
Company began applying the new accounting  rules effective  January 1, 2002.

     The  adoption  of SFAS No. 142  required  the Company to perform an initial
impairment  assessment on all goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as
of January 1, 2002. The Company  compared the fair value of trademarks and other
intangible  assets to the current carrying value. Fair values were derived using
discounted  cash flow analyses.  The assumptions  used in these  discounted cash
flow  analyses  were  consistent  with our internal  planning.  Valuations  were
completed  for  intangible  assets for both the  Company  and our equity  method
investees.  For the Company's  intangible  assets, the cumulative effect of this
change in  accounting  principle  was an  after-tax  decrease  to net  income of
approximately $367 million. For the Company's  proportionate share of its equity
method investees,  the cumulative effect of this change in accounting  principle
was an  after-tax  decrease to net income of  approximately  $559  million.  The
deferred income tax benefit related to the cumulative  effect of this change for
the  Company's  intangible  assets was  approximately  $94  million  and for the
Company's  proportionate  share of its equity method investees was approximately
$123 million.

     The impairment  charges  resulting in the after-tax  decrease to net income
for the cumulative  effect of this change by applicable  operating segment as of
January 1, 2002 are as follows (in millions):

================================================================================

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Of the Company's $226 million  impairment for Latin America,  approximately
$113 million relates to Company-owned  Brazilian bottlers' franchise rights. The
Brazilian  macroeconomic  conditions,  the devaluation of the currency and lower
pricing  impacted  the  valuation  of  these  bottlers'  franchise  rights.  The
remainder of the $226 million primarily relates to a $109 million impairment for
certain  trademarks  in Latin  America.  In early  1999,  our  Company  formed a
strategic  partnership  to market and  distribute  such  trademark  brands.  The
macroeconomic conditions and lower pricing depressed operating margins for these
trademarks.

     Of the $108 million impairment for the Company in Asia, $99 million relates
to bottlers' franchise rights in our consolidated  bottlers in our Southeast and
West Asia  Division.  Difficult  economic  conditions  impacted  our business in
Singapore,  Sri  Lanka,  Nepal  and  Vietnam.  As a  result,  bottlers  in these
countries experienced lower than expected volume and operating margins.

     For Europe, Eurasia and Middle East equity method investees, a $400 million
impairment  was  recorded  for the  Company's  proportionate  share  related  to
bottlers'  franchise rights. Of this amount,  approximately $301 million related
to CCEAG. This impairment was due to a prolonged difficult economic  environment
in Germany,  resulting in continuing  losses for CCEAG in eastern  Germany.  The
market for nonalcoholic  beverages is currently  undergoing a transformation.  A
changing competitive landscape, continuing price pressure,

                     The Coca-Cola Company and Subsidiaries

and growing demand for new products and packaging were elements impacting CCEAG.
The $400 million  impairment  also included a $50 million charge for Middle East
bottlers'  franchise  rights.  In our Africa  operating  segment,  a $63 million
charge was recorded for the Company's proportionate share of impairments related
to equity method  investee  bottlers'  franchise  rights.  These Middle East and
Africa  bottlers have  challenges as a result of political  instability  and the
resulting economic instability, in their respective regions, which has adversely
impacted financial performance.

     A $96 million impairment was recorded for the Company's proportionate share
related to bottlers'  franchise rights of Latin America equity method investees.
In southern Latin America,  the macroeconomic  conditions and devaluation of the
Argentine  peso  significantly  impacted the  valuation  of bottlers'  franchise
rights.

     As discussed in Note 18, the Company acquired certain  intangible assets in
connection  with the business  combinations of CCEAG,  Cosmos  Bottling  Company
(CBC)  and  CCDA  Waters  L.L.C.  (CCDA).  Because  such  assets  were  assigned
indefinite lives, no amortization will be recorded.

subject to  amortization  and for intangible  assets not subject to amortization
(in millions):

NOTE 6: SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND
CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS

Loans and Notes  Payable  consist  primarily of  commercial  paper issued in the
United  States.  On December  31,  2002 and 2001,  we had  approximately  $2,122
million  and $3,361  million,  respectively,  outstanding  in  commercial  paper
borrowings. Our weighted-average interest rates for commercial paper outstanding
were  approximately  1.4 percent and 1.9 percent at December  31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.  In addition,  we had $2,331  million in lines of credit and other
short-term  credit  facilities  available  as of  December  31,  2002,  of which
approximately  $353 million was  outstanding.  All of this $353  million  amount
relates to our international subsidiaries.  Included in the available facilities
discussed  above,  the Company had $1,900 million in lines of credit for general
corporate purposes,  including commercial paper back-up, which had no borrowings
during 2002.

     These  facilities are subject to normal banking terms and conditions.  Some
of the financial  arrangements require compensating  balances,  none of which is
presently significant to our Company.

NOTE 9: FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
- -----------------------------------
The carrying amounts reflected in our balance sheets for cash, cash equivalents,
marketable equity securities,  cost method investments,  receivables,  loans and
notes payable and long-term debt approximate their respective fair values.  Fair
values are based  primarily on quoted  prices for those or similar  instruments.
Fair values for our derivative financial instruments are included in Note 10.

Credit Risk
- -----------
With respect to our Cash and Cash Equivalents  balances,  we manage our exposure
to  counterparty   credit  risk  through  specific  minimum  credit   standards,
diversification  of  counterparties  and procedures to monitor  concentration of
credit  risk.  Based on these  factors,  we  consider  the risk of  counterparty
default to be minimal.

Investments in debt and marketable  equity  securities,  other than  investments
accounted for by the equity  method,  are required to be  categorized  as either
trading, available-for-sale or held-to-maturity.  On December 31, 2002 and 2001,

stated at fair value,  with unrealized gains and losses,  net of deferred income
taxes,  reported  as  a  component  of  AOCI.  Debt  securities  categorized  as
held-to-maturity are stated at amortized cost.

NOTE 10: HEDGING TRANSACTIONS AND DERIVATIVE
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Our  Company  uses  derivative  financial  instruments  primarily  to reduce our
exposure to adverse  fluctuations  in interest rates and foreign  exchange rates
and, to a lesser  extent,  in  commodity  prices and other  market  risks.  When
entered  into,  the Company  formally  designates  and  documents  the financial
instrument  as a hedge of a specific  underlying  exposure,  as well as the risk
management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transactions. The
Company  formally  assesses,  both  at  the  inception  and at  least  quarterly
thereafter,   whether  the  financial  instruments  that  are  used  in  hedging
transactions  are  effective at  offsetting  changes in either the fair value or
cash flows of the  related  underlying  exposure.  Because of the high degree of
effectiveness  between the hedging instrument and the underlying  exposure being
hedged,  fluctuations  in the value of the derivative  instruments are generally
offset by changes in the fair  value or cash flows of the  underlying  exposures
being hedged. Any ineffective portion of a financial instrument's change in fair
value is immediately  recognized in earnings.  Virtually all of our  derivatives
are  straightforward  over-the-counter  instruments  with  liquid  markets.  Our
Company  does not  enter  into  derivative  financial  instruments  for  trading
purposes.

     The fair values of derivatives  used to hedge or modify our risks fluctuate
over time. We do not view these fair value  amounts in isolation,  but rather in
relation to the fair values or cash flows of the underlying hedged  transactions
or other exposures. The notional amounts of the derivative financial instruments
do not necessarily  represent amounts  exchanged by the parties and,  therefore,
are not a direct measure of our exposure to the financial risks described above.
The amounts exchanged are calculated by reference to the notional amounts and by
other terms of the derivatives,  such as interest rates, exchange rates or other
financial indices.

     As  discussed  in Note 1, the Company  adopted  SFAS No. 133, as amended by
SFAS No. 137 and SFAS No. 138, on January 1, 2001. These statements  require the
Company to recognize all derivative  instruments as either assets or liabilities
in our balance  sheets at fair  value.  The  accounting  for changes in the fair
value of a derivative  instrument  depends on whether it has been designated and
qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, further, on the type of hedging
relationship.  At the  inception  of the hedge  relationship,  the Company  must
designate the  derivative  instrument as either a fair value hedge,  a cash flow
hedge or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. This designation is
based upon the exposure being hedged.

     The adoption of SFAS No. 133 resulted in the Company  recording  transition
adjustments  to  recognize  its  derivative  instruments  at fair  value  and to
recognize  the  ineffective   portion  of  the  change  in  fair  value  of  its
derivatives.  The  cumulative  effect  of these  transition  adjustments  was an
after-tax  reduction to Net Income of approximately $10 million and an after-tax
net increase to AOCI of approximately  $50 million.  The reduction to Net Income
was primarily  related to the change in the time value and fair value of foreign
currency options and interest rate swap agreements,  respectively.  The increase
in AOCI was primarily related to net gains on foreign currency cash flow hedges.
The Company  reclassified  into earnings during the year ended December 31, 2001
approximately  $54 million of net gains  relating to the  transition  adjustment
recorded in AOCI as of January 1, 2001.

     We have established  strict  counterparty  credit guidelines and enter into
transactions only with financial  institutions of investment grade or better. We
monitor  counterparty  exposures daily and review any downgrade in credit rating
immediately.  If a  downgrade  in the credit  rating of a  counterparty  were to
occur, we have provisions  requiring  collateral in the form of U.S.  government
securities for substantially all of our transactions.  To mitigate presettlement
risk,  minimum  credit  standards  become more  stringent as the duration of the
derivative  financial  instrument  increases.  To minimize the  concentration of
credit risk, we enter into derivative transactions with a portfolio of financial
institutions.  The  Company  has  master  netting  agreements  with  most of the
financial  institutions that are  counterparties to the derivative  instruments.
These agreements allow for the net settlement of assets and liabilities  arising
from different transactions with the same counterparty.  Based on these factors,
we consider the risk of counterparty default to be minimal.

Interest Rate Management
- ------------------------
Our Company monitors our percentage mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, as
well as our  percentage mix of term debt versus  nonterm debt.  This  monitoring
includes a review of  business  and other  financial  risks.  We also enter into
interest  rate swap  agreements  to manage  these  risks.  These  contracts  had
maturities ranging from one to three

                     The Coca-Cola Company and Subsidiaries

years on December  31, 2002.  Interest  rate swap  agreements  that meet certain
conditions  required  under SFAS No. 133 for fair value hedges are accounted for
as such with the offset  recorded  to adjust  the fair  value of the  underlying
exposure being hedged.  Any  ineffective  portion (which was not  significant in
2002 or 2001) of the changes in the fair value of these  agreements  is recorded
in earnings  immediately.  The fair values of our  Company's  interest rate swap
agreements  were  approximately  $44 million and $5 million at December 31, 2002
and 2001,  respectively.  The Company  estimates  the fair value of its interest
rate management derivatives based on quoted market prices.

     Prior to January 1, 2001,  our Company  also used  interest  rate swaps and
interest  rate  caps  for  hedging  purposes.   For  interest  rate  swaps,  any
differences  paid or received were recognized as adjustments to interest expense
over the life of each swap, thereby adjusting the effective interest rate on the
underlying obligation.  Additionally,  prior to January 1, 2001, our Company had
entered into an interest rate cap  agreement  that entitled us to receive from a
financial  institution the amount, if any, by which our interest payments on our
variable rate debt exceeded  prespecified  interest rates through 2004. This cap
agreement was terminated during 2001, and the impact on the statements of income
was immaterial.

Foreign Currency Management
- ---------------------------
The purpose of our foreign  currency  hedging  activities  is to reduce the risk
that our eventual U.S. dollar net cash inflows  resulting from sales outside the
United States will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.

     We enter into forward exchange  contracts and collars and purchase currency
options  (principally  euro and  Japanese  yen) to  hedge  certain  portions  of
forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign  currencies.  The effective portion
of the changes in fair value for these contracts,  which have been designated as
cash flow hedges,  are reported in AOCI and  reclassified  into  earnings in the
same  financial  statement  line item and in the same  period or periods  during
which the hedged transaction  affects earnings.  Any ineffective  portion (which
was not  significant  in 2002 or  2001)  of the  change  in fair  value of these
instruments  is  immediately   recognized  in  earnings.   These  contracts  had
maturities ranging from one to two years on December 31, 2002, which is also the
period in which all amounts included in AOCI will be reclassified into earnings.

     Additionally,  the Company enters into forward exchange  contracts that are
not designated as hedging  instruments under SFAS No. 133. These instruments are
used to offset the earnings impact relating to the variability in exchange rates
on  certain  monetary  assets  and  liabilities  denominated  in  non-functional
currencies.  Changes in the fair value of these  instruments  are  recognized in
earnings in the Other Income  (Loss)-Net  line item of our  statements of income
immediately  to offset the effect of  remeasurement  of the monetary  assets and
liabilities.

     The Company  also enters into forward  exchange  contracts to hedge its net
investment position in certain major currencies.  Under SFAS No. 133, changes in
the  fair  value  of  these  instruments  are  recognized  in  foreign  currency
translation  adjustment,  a component of AOCI, to offset the change in the value
of the net  investment  being hedged.  For the years ended December 31, 2002 and
2001,  approximately  $26  million  and $43  million,  respectively,  of  losses
relating to derivative  financial  instruments were recorded in foreign currency
translation adjustment.

     Prior to  January  1,  2001,  gains  and  losses  on  derivative  financial
instruments  that were  designated and effective as hedges of net investments in
international   operations  were  included  in  foreign   currency   translation
adjustment, a component of AOCI.

     For the years ended  December  31,  2002 and 2001,  we recorded an increase
(decrease)   to  AOCI  of   approximately   $(151)   million  and  $92  million,
respectively,  net of both  income  taxes  and  reclassifications  to  earnings,
primarily  related to net gains  (losses) on foreign  currency cash flow hedges,
which  will  generally  offset  cash  flow  gains  and  losses  relating  to the
underlying  exposures being hedged in future periods. The Company estimates that
it  will   reclassify  into  earnings  during  the  next  12  months  losses  of
approximately $8 million from the net amount recorded in AOCI as of December 31,
2002 as the anticipated  foreign  currency cash flows occur.  For the year ended
December 31, 2001, the Company recorded  approximately  $12 million in earnings,
classified within Net Operating Revenues in our statements of income,  primarily
related  to the change in the time value of  foreign  currency  options.  During
2001,  the FASB issued an  interpretation  to SFAS No. 133  allowing  the entire
change in fair value,  including the time value, of certain purchased options to
be  recorded  in AOCI until the  related  underlying  exposure  is  recorded  in
earnings. The Company adopted this interpretation prospectively.

     The Company  estimates the fair value of its foreign  currency  derivatives
based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates. This
amount is primarily  reflected in Prepaid  Expenses and Other Assets  within our
balance sheets.

     Prior to January 1, 2001, our Company also used foreign exchange  contracts
and purchased currency options for hedging purposes.  Premiums paid and realized
gains and losses, including those on any terminated contracts,  were included in
Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets.  These were recognized in income,  along with
unrealized gains and losses,  in the same period the hedging  transactions  were
realized.

NOTE 11: COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

On December 31, 2002, we were contingently liable for guarantees of indebtedness
owed by third  parties  in the amount of $494  million.  We do not  consider  it
probable that we will be required to satisfy these guarantees.

     We believe our exposure to  concentrations of credit risk is limited due to
the diverse geographic areas covered by our operations.

     We have  committed  to make  future  marketing  and other  expenditures  of
approximately  $2,550 million, of which the majority is payable over the next 12
years.

     In June 2002, our Company announced long-term  agreements with the National
Collegiate  Athletic  Association  (NCAA) and CBS,  and with the Houston  Astros
Baseball  Club  for a  combined  value of  approximately  $650  million  to $800
million.  These  commitments  are  included  in the future  marketing  and other
expenditures amount referred to in the preceding paragraph.

     The  Company is also  involved  in various  legal  proceedings.  Management
believes  that  any  liability  to the  Company  that may  arise as a result  of
currently pending legal  proceedings,  including those discussed below, will not
have a material  adverse effect on the financial  condition of the Company taken
as a whole.

     During the period from 1970 to 1981,  our  Company  owned  Aqua-Chem,  Inc.
(Aqua-Chem). A division of Aqua-Chem manufactured certain boilers that contained
gaskets that Aqua-Chem purchased from outside suppliers. Several years after our
Company  sold this entity,  Aqua-Chem  received  its first  lawsuit  relating to
asbestos, a component of some of the gaskets. Aqua-Chem has notified our Company
that it believes we are obligated to them for certain costs and expenses

associated  with  the  litigation.  Aqua-Chem  has  demanded  that  our  Company
reimburse it for approximately $10 million for out-of-pocket  litigation-related
expenses  incurred over the last 18 years.  Aqua-Chem has also demanded that the
Company  acknowledge  a  continuing  obligation  to  Aqua-Chem  for  any  future
liabilities  and expenses that are excluded from coverage  under the  applicable
insurance or for which there is no insurance.  Our Company disputes  Aqua-Chem's
claims,  and we believe we have no  obligation to Aqua-Chem for any of its past,
present or future  liabilities,  costs or expenses.  Furthermore,  we believe we
have substantial legal and factual defenses to Aqua-Chem's  claims.  The parties
have  entered into  litigation  to resolve this  dispute.  The Company  believes
Aqua-Chem  has  substantial  insurance  coverage  to  pay  Aqua-Chem's  asbestos
claimants.  An estimate of possible  losses over time, if any, cannot be made at
this time.

     The  Competition  Authority of the  European  Commission  made  unannounced
visits to the  offices of the  Company  and our  bottling  partners  in Austria,
Belgium,  Denmark,  Germany and Great Britain several years ago. Similarly,  the
Spanish  competition  authorities made unannounced visits to our own offices and
those of certain  bottlers in Spain in 2000.  The  European  Commission  and the
Spanish competition  authorities  continue their investigations into unspecified
market practices in their respective jurisdictions. The Company believes we have
substantial legal and factual defenses in these matters.

     Additionally,  at the time of  divesting  our  interest  in a  consolidated
entity,  we  sometimes  agree to indemnify  the buyer for  specific  liabilities
related  to the  period  we  owned  the  entity.  Management  believes  that any
liability to the Company that may arise as a result of any such  indemnification
agreements will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of
the Company taken as a whole.

stock plans under the recognition  and measurement  provisions of APB No. 25 and
related  interpretations.  Effective  January 1, 2002,  our Company  adopted the
preferable  fair value  recognition  provisions  of SFAS No.  123.  Our  Company
selected the modified  prospective method of adoption described in SFAS No. 148.
Compensation  cost  recognized in 2002 is the same as that which would have been
recognized  had the fair  value  method of SFAS No.  123 been  applied  from its
original effective date. Refer to Note 1.

     In  accordance  with the  provisions of SFAS No. 123 and SFAS No. 148, $365
million was  recorded for total  stock-based  compensation  expense in 2002.  In
accordance  with APB No. 25,  total  stock-based  compensation  expense  was $41
million and $43 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2001 and
2000.

Stock Option Plans
- ------------------
Under our 1991  Stock  Option  Plan (the 1991  Option  Plan),  a maximum  of 120
million  shares of our common stock was approved to be issued or  transferred to
certain officers and employees  pursuant to stock options and stock appreciation
rights granted under the 1991 Option Plan. The stock appreciation  rights permit
the holder,  upon  surrendering  all or part of the  related  stock  option,  to
receive  cash,  common stock or a  combination  thereof,  in an amount up to 100
percent of the difference between the market price and the option price. Options
to purchase common stock under the 1991 Option Plan have been granted to Company
employees at fair market value at the date of grant.

The 1999 Stock  Option Plan (the 1999 Option  Plan) was approved by share owners
in April of 1999. Following the approval of the 1999 Option Plan, no grants were
made from the 1991 Option Plan, and shares  available under the 1991 Option Plan
were no longer available to be granted. Under the 1999 Option Plan, a maximum of
120 million  shares of our common stock was approved to be issued or transferred
to certain  officers and employees  pursuant to stock options  granted under the
1999 Option  Plan.  Options to purchase  common stock under the 1999 Option Plan
have been  granted  to Company  employees  at fair  market  value at the date of
grant.

     The 2002 Stock  Option  Plan (the 2002 Option  Plan) was  approved by share
owners in April of 2002.  Under the 2002 Option  Plan,  a maximum of 120 million
shares of our common stock was approved to be issued or  transferred  to certain
officers and employees  pursuant to stock options  granted under the 2002 Option
Plan.  Options to  purchase  common  stock  under the 2002 Option Plan have been
granted to Company employees at fair market value at the date of grant.

     Generally, stock options become exercisable over a four-year graded vesting
period and expire 15 years from the date of grant.  Prior to 1999, stock options
generally  became  exercisable  over a three-year  vesting period and expired 10
years from the date of grant.

     To ensure the best  market-based  assumptions  were used to  determine  the
estimated  fair  value  of  stock  options  granted  in 2002,  we  obtained  two
independent market quotes. Our Black-Scholes value was not materially  different
from the independent quotes.

     The  following  table sets forth  information  about the fair value of each
option grant on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes  option-pricing  model
and the weighted-average assumptions used for such grants:

Restricted Stock Award Plans
- ----------------------------
Under  the  amended  1989  Restricted  Stock  Award  Plan and the  amended  1983
Restricted Stock Award Plan (the Restricted  Stock Award Plans),  40 million and
24 million shares of restricted  common stock,  respectively,  may be granted to
certain officers and key employees of our Company.

     On December 31, 2002, 29 million  shares were available for grant under the
Restricted  Stock Award Plans.  In 2002,  there were 30,000 shares of restricted
stock granted at an average fair value of $50.99 per share. In 2001,  there were
116,300  shares of  restricted  stock granted at an average fair value of $48.95
per share. In 2000,  there were 546,585 shares of restricted stock granted at an
average  fair value of $58.20 per share.  In 2002,  2,500  shares of  restricted
stock  were  cancelled  at an average  fair value of $67.50 per share.  In 2001,
78,700  shares of  restricted  stock were  cancelled at an average fair value of
$48.49 per share. In 2000,  80,500 shares of restricted  stock were cancelled at
an average fair value of $28.41 per share. Participants are entitled to vote and
receive dividends on the shares and, under the 1983 Restricted Stock Award Plan,
participants  are  reimbursed  by our  Company for income  taxes  imposed on the
award, but not for taxes generated by the reimbursement  payment. The shares are
subject to certain  transfer  restrictions and may be forfeited if a participant
leaves our Company  for  reasons  other than  retirement,  disability  or death,
absent a change in control of our Company.

     In addition,  270,000 shares of three-year  performance-based and 2,025,000
shares of five-year performance-based restricted stock were granted in 2000. The
release of these  shares  was  contingent  upon the  Company  achieving  certain
predefined  performance  targets over the three-year  and five-year  measurement
periods, respectively.  Participants were entitled to vote and receive dividends
on these shares  during the  measurement  period.  The Company also  promised to
grant  180,000  shares of stock at the end of three years and 200,000  shares at
the end of five years to certain  employees if the Company  achieved  predefined
performance targets over the respective measurement periods.

     In May 2001,  all  performance-based  restricted  stock awards and promises
made to grant shares in the future were cancelled, with the exception of 150,000
shares of five-year performance-based  restricted stock. New awards for the same
number of cancelled  shares,  with the exception of the promises made in 2000 to
grant 200,000  shares at the end of five years,  were granted at an average fair
value of $47.88 per share. The release of the shares is subject to the Company's
achievement  of a minimum of 11 percent annual growth in earnings per share over
the respective  measurement  periods,  as adjusted for certain items approved by
the Board of  Directors.  In 2001,  an  additional  10,000  shares of three-year
performance-based    restricted   stock   and   50,000   shares   of   five-year
performance-based  restricted  stock were  granted  at an average  fair value of
$46.22 per share and $45.70 per share, respectively, with predefined performance
targets to be achieved  over the  respective  measurement  periods.  In 2001, an
additional 250,000 shares of five-year  performance-based  restricted stock were
granted at an average fair value of $46.80 per share.

     In  2002,  an  additional  50,000  shares  of  four-year  performance-based
restricted  stock were granted at an average fair value of $46.88 per share. The
release of the shares is subject to the Company's achievement of a minimum of 11
percent  annual  growth in  earnings  per share over the  four-year  measurement
period,  as adjusted for certain items  approved by the Board of  Directors.  In
2002, the Company also promised to grant 50,000 shares at the end of three years
and 75,000 shares

Our Company  sponsors and/or  contributes to pension and  postretirement  health
care and life insurance benefit plans covering substantially all U.S. employees.

     We made income tax payments of approximately $1,508 million, $1,496 million
and  $1,425  million  in 2002,  2001 and 2000,  respectively.  During  the first
quarter of 2000, the U.S. and Japan taxing  authorities  entered into an Advance
Pricing Agreement (APA) whereby the level of royalties paid by Coca-Cola (Japan)
Company, Ltd. (our Subsidiary) to our Company was established for the years 1993
through  2001.  Pursuant to the terms of the APA, our  Subsidiary  filed amended
returns for the applicable periods reflecting the negotiated royalty rate. These
amended returns  resulted in the payment during the first and second quarters of
2000 of additional  Japanese taxes. The effect on our financial  performance and
our effective tax rate was not material, due primarily to offsetting tax credits
utilized on our U.S. income tax return.

     A reconciliation  of the statutory U.S. federal rate and effective rates is
as follows:

     Our  effective  tax rate  reflects  the tax  benefit  derived  from  having
significant  operations  outside the United States that are taxed at rates lower
than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent.

     In 2002 and 2000,  management  concluded  that it was more  likely than not
that tax benefits would not be realized with respect to  principally  all of the
items discussed in Note 16, with the exception of approximately  $188 million of
charges in 2000 related to the settlement terms of a class action discrimination
lawsuit.  Accordingly,  valuation  allowances were recorded to offset the future
tax benefit of these items  resulting in an increase in our  effective tax rate.
Excluding the impact of these items,  the  effective tax rate on operations  for
2002 was 27 percent and for 2000 was slightly more than 30 percent.

     Undistributed  earnings of the Company's foreign  subsidiaries  amounted to
approximately  $6.1 billion at December 31, 2002.  Those earnings are considered

state  income  taxes have been  provided  thereon.  Upon  distribution  of those
earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise,  the Company would be subject to
both U.S.  income taxes  (subject to an adjustment  for foreign tax credits) and
withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries. Determination of the
amount of  unrecognized  deferred U.S.  income tax liability is not  practicable
because  of the  complexities  associated  with  its  hypothetical  calculation;
however, unrecognized foreign tax credits would be available to reduce a portion
of the U.S. liability.

     On December 31, 2002 and 2001,  we had  approximately  $34 million and $240
million,  respectively,  of net deferred tax assets located in countries outside
the United States.

     On  December  31,  2002,  we  had  $1,387  million  of tax  operating  loss
carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income of certain international
subsidiaries.  Loss  carryforwards  of $614 million must be utilized  within the
next five years;  $483  million can be utilized  over an  indefinite  period.  A
valuation  allowance  has been provided for a portion of the deferred tax assets
related to these loss carryforwards.

NOTE 16: SIGNIFICANT OPERATING AND
NONOPERATING ITEMS

In the  third quarter of 2002, our Company  recorded a noncash  pretax charge of
approximately  $33 million related to our share of impairment and  restructuring
charges taken by certain investees in Latin America. This charge was recorded in
the caption Equity Income (Loss).

     Our  Company  had  direct  and  indirect   ownership   interests   totaling
approximately  18 percent in Cervejarias  Kaiser S.A.  (Kaiser  S.A.).  In March
2002,  Kaiser S.A. sold its  investment in Cervejarias  Kaiser  Brazil,  Ltda to
Molson Inc. (Molson) for cash of approximately $485 million and shares of Molson
valued at  approximately  $150 million.  Our Company's  pretax share of the gain
related to this sale was approximately $43 million,  of which  approximately $21
million was recorded in the caption Equity Income (Loss),  and approximately $22
million was recorded in the caption Other Income (Loss)-Net.

     In the first quarter of 2002, our Company  recorded a noncash pretax charge
of approximately $157 million (recorded in the caption Other Income (Loss)-Net),
primarily  related to the  write-down of certain  investments  in Latin America.
This  write-down  reduced the carrying value of the investments in Latin America
to fair value. The charge was primarily the result of the economic  developments
in Argentina during the first quarter of 2002,  including the devaluation of the
Argentine peso and the severity of the unfavorable economic outlook.

     In the first quarter of 2000,  we recorded  charges of  approximately  $405
million  related  to the  impairment  of  certain  bottling,  manufacturing  and
intangible  assets,  primarily  within our  Indian  bottling  operations.  These
impairment  charges were recorded to reduce the carrying value of the identified
assets to fair  value.  Fair value was  derived  using cash flow  analysis.  The
assumptions used in the cash flow analysis were consistent with those used in


                                                         2002 ANNUAL REPORT - 99

our internal  planning.  The assumptions  included estimates of future growth in
unit cases,  estimates  of gross  margins,  estimates  of the impact of exchange
rates and  estimates of tax rates and  incentives.  The charge was primarily the
result of our  revised  outlook for the Indian  beverage  market  including  the
future  expected tax  environment.  The remaining  carrying  value of long-lived
assets within our Indian bottling  operations,  immediately  after recording the
impairment charge, was approximately $300 million.

     In July 2000,  we recorded a tax-free  noncash gain of  approximately  $118
million  related to the merger of  Coca-Cola  Beverages  and  Hellenic  Bottling
Company S.A. Refer to Note 2.

     In the fourth quarter of 2000, we recorded  charges of  approximately  $188
million related to the settlement terms of, and direct costs related to, a class
action discrimination lawsuit. The monetary settlement included cash payments to
fund  back  pay,  compensatory  damages,  a  promotional  achievement  fund  and
attorneys' fees. In addition,  the Company  introduced a wide range of training,
monitoring and mentoring programs.  Of the $188 million, $50 million was donated
to The  Coca-Cola  Foundation  to continue its broad range of community  support
programs. In 2001, our Company paid out substantially all of this settlement.

     In 2000, the Company also recorded a charge of approximately  $306 million,
which represents the Company's  portion of a charge recorded by Coca-Cola Amatil
to reduce the carrying value of its investment in the Philippines.  In addition,
Panamerican Beverages, Inc. wrote down selected assets, including the impairment
of the value of its Venezuelan  operating  unit.  The Company's  portion of this
charge was  approximately  $124 million.  Also contributing to the equity losses
were charges recorded by investees in Eurasia and the Middle East. These charges
were  partially  offset by the impact of lower tax rates  related to current and
deferred taxes at CCEAG.

NOTE 17: REALIGNMENT COSTS

In January 2000, our Company initiated a major  organizational  realignment (the
Realignment)  intended to put more responsibility,  accountability and resources
in the hands of local  business units of the Company so as to fully leverage the
local capabilities of our system.

     Under the Realignment,  employees were separated from almost all functional
areas of the Company's  operations,  and certain  activities  were outsourced to
third parties.  The total number of employees  separated as of December 31, 2000
was approximately 5,200. Employees separated from the Company as a result of the
Realignment were offered severance or early retirement packages, as appropriate,
that  included both  financial  and  nonfinancial  components.  The  Realignment
expenses  included costs  associated with  involuntary  terminations,  voluntary
retirements and other direct costs associated with implementing the Realignment.
Other direct  costs  included  repatriating  and  relocating  employees to local
markets; asset write-downs;  lease cancellation costs; and costs associated with
the  development,  communication  and  administration  of  the  Realignment.  We
recorded total Realignment  charges in 2000 of $850 million,  which was included
in the caption Other Operating Charges.

     The Realignment has been completed,  and all material  payments  associated
with the  Realignment  have been made except for retirement pay and benefits for
employees who voluntarily accepted early retirement packages, which will be paid
out in accordance with the Company's defined benefit pension plans over a number
of years.

NOTE 18: ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS

During  2002,  our  Company's   acquisition  and  investment   activity  totaled
approximately  $1,144  million.  Of this $1,144  million,  our Company paid $544
million in cash.

     Effective  February 2002, our Company acquired  control of CCEAG.  CCEAG is
included in our Europe,  Eurasia and Middle East operating segment.  As a result
of acquiring  control of CCEAG,  our Company expects to help focus its sales and
marketing  programs and assist in developing the business.  This transaction was
accounted for as a business  combination,  and the results of CCEAG's operations
have been included in the Company's  financial  statements  since February 2002.
Prior to February 2002, our Company  accounted for CCEAG under the equity method
of  accounting.  As of December  31,  2002,  our Company had an  approximate  41
percent  ownership  interest in the  outstanding  shares of CCEAG. In accordance
with the terms of a Control and Profit and Loss  Transfer  Agreement  (CPL) with
CCEAG,  our Company  obtained control of CCEAG for a period of up to five years.
In return for control of CCEAG, the Company guaranteed annual payments,  in lieu
of dividends by CCEAG, to all other CCEAG share owners.  These guaranteed annual
payments  equal .76 euro for each CCEAG  share  outstanding.  Additionally,  all
other CCEAG share owners entered into either a put or put/call option  agreement
with  the  Company,  exercisable  at the end of the  term  of the CPL at  agreed
prices.  Our Company  entered into either put or put/call  agreements for shares
representing  an  approximate  59 percent  interest in CCEAG.  The spread in the
strike prices of the put and call options is approximately 3 percent.

     As of the date of the transaction,  the Company concluded that the exercise
of the put and/or call  agreements was a virtual  certainty based on the minimal
differences in the strike prices. We concluded that either the holder of the put
option would require the Company to purchase the shares at the  agreed-upon  put
strike  price,  or the Company  would  exercise  its call option and require the
share  owner to tender its shares at the  agreed-upon  call  strike  price.  The
holders of the puts or calls may exercise their rights at any time up to


2002 ANNUAL REPORT - 101

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                     The Coca-Cola Company and Subsidiaries

the expiration  date,  which in this case is in five years.  If these rights are
exercised,  the actual  transfer of shares  would not occur until the end of the
term of the CPL.  Coupled with the guaranteed  payments in lieu of dividends for
the term of the CPL, these instruments represented the financing vehicle for the
transaction.  As such, the Company determined that the economic substance of the
transaction  resulted in the acquisition of the remaining  outstanding shares of
CCEAG and  required  the  Company to account for the  transaction  as a business
combination.  Furthermore,  the terms of the CPL transfer control and all of the
economic risks and rewards of CCEAG to the Company immediately.

     The present  value of the total amount  likely to be paid by our Company to
all other CCEAG share  owners,  including  the put or put/call  payments and the
guaranteed annual payments in lieu of dividends,  is approximately  $741 million
at December 31, 2002.  This amount has increased  from the initial  liability of
approximately  $600 million due to the accretion of the discounted  value to the
ultimate maturity of the liability described below, as well as approximately $95
million of translation  adjustment related to this liability.  This liability is
included in the caption Other Liabilities. The accretion of the discounted value
to its  ultimate  maturity  value  was  recorded  in the  caption  Other  Income
(Loss)-Net,  and this  amount was  approximately  $38 million for the year ended
December 31, 2002. As of December 31, 2002, the Company's balance sheet included
property,  plant and equipment with a fair value of approximately  $961 million,
bottler  franchise  rights with a fair value of  approximately  $576 million and
goodwill  with a fair value of  approximately  $419  million.  These amounts are
composed  of  approximately  41  percent of our  historic  book value of CCEAG's
property, plant and equipment,  franchise rights and goodwill, and approximately
59 percent of the fair value of CCEAG's property, plant and equipment, franchise
rights and goodwill  computed at the  acquisition  date.  The bottler  franchise
rights,  which  authorize the bottler to manufacture  and distribute  designated
Company  trademark  beverages within  identified  territories,  were assigned an
indefinite life. The goodwill,  which is not currently expected to be deductible
for tax purposes,  is reported in the Europe,  Eurasia and Middle East operating
segment.  As of December 31, 2002,  CCEAG had outstanding  debt of $843 million.
The purchase price allocation is subject to refinement.

     In July 2002, our Company and Danone Waters of North America,  Inc.  (DWNA)
formed the new company, CCDA, for the production,  marketing and distribution of
DWNA's bottled spring and source water business in the United States. In forming
CCDA,  DWNA  contributed  assets of its retail  bottled  spring and source water
business in the United States. These assets include five production  facilities,
a license for the use of the Dannon and Sparkletts  brands, as well as ownership
of  several  value  brands.  Our  Company  made  a cash  payment  to  acquire  a
controlling 51 percent equity interest in CCDA and is also providing  marketing,
distribution and management  expertise.  This transaction was accounted for as a
business combination, and the results of CCDA's operations have been included in
our financial statements since July 2002. This business combination expanded our
water brands to include a national offering in all sectors of the water category
with purified, spring and source waters.

     In January  2002,  our  Company  and CCBPI  finalized  the  purchase of RFM
Corp.'s  (RFM)  approximate  83  percent  interest  in CBC,  a  publicly  traded
Philippine  beverage company.  The original sale and purchase agreement with RFM
was entered  into in  November  2001.  As of the date of this sale and  purchase
agreement,  the Company began supplying concentrate for this operation. In March
2002,  a tender offer was  completed  with our Company and CCBPI  acquiring  all
shares of the remaining minority share owners except for shares representing a 1
percent interest in CBC. As of December 31, 2002, our Company's direct ownership
interest  in CBC  was  approximately  61  percent,  and our  indirect  ownership
interest in CBC was approximately 13 percent. This transaction was accounted for
as a  business  combination,  and the  results  of CBC's  operations  have  been
included in our financial  statements  since January 2002. CBC is an established
carbonated  soft-drink  business in the  Philippines.  Our Company's  goal is to
leverage our partnership with San Miguel in the Philippines, as well as leverage
our sales, marketing and system resources,  to expand CBC volume and profit over
time.  The Company and CCBPI have agreed to  restructure  the operations of CBC,
and this restructuring will result in the Company owning all acquired trademarks
and CCBPI owning all acquired bottling assets.

     Our  Company  acquired  controlling  interests  in CCDA  and CBC for  total
combined consideration of approximately

$328 million.  CCDA is included in our North America operating segment,  and CBC
is included in our Asia operating segment.  The Company has currently  allocated
approximately  $91  million  of the  purchase  price for these  acquisitions  to
goodwill and $186 million to other indefinite lived intangible assets, primarily
trademarks,  brands and  licenses.  Of the $91  million for this  goodwill,  $63
million is allocated to our North America  operating  segment and $28 million is
allocated to our Asia  segment.  As of December 31, 2002,  the Company  recorded
minority  ownership  accruals of  approximately  $228  million  related to these
acquisitions in the caption Other Liabilities. The purchase price allocation for
CBC  was  completed  in  2002.  The  purchase  price  allocation  for  the  CCDA
acquisition is subject to refinement based on completion of asset valuations.

     The  combined  2002 Net  Operating  Revenues  of  CCEAG,  CBC and CCDA were
approximately $1.3 billion.

     During 2001,  our Company's  acquisition  and investment  activity  totaled
approximately  $651 million.  In February 2001, our Company reached an agreement
with Carlsberg for the dissolution of CCNB, a joint venture bottler in which our
Company had a 49 percent  ownership  interest.  At that time,  CCNB had bottling
operations in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland and Iceland. Under this agreement
with  Carlsberg,   our  Company  acquired  CCNB's  Sweden  and  Norway  bottling
operations in June 2001, increasing our Company's ownership in those bottlers to
100 percent.  Carlsberg acquired CCNB's Denmark and Finland bottling operations,
increasing  Carlsberg's ownership in those bottlers to 100 percent.  Pursuant to
the agreement,  CCNB sold its Iceland bottling operations to a third-party group
of investors in May 2001.

     In March 2001,  our Company  signed a definitive  agreement with La Tondena
Distillers,  Inc. (La Tondena) and San Miguel to acquire carbonated  soft-drink,
water and juice brands for $84 million. CCBPI acquired the related manufacturing
and distribution assets from La Tondena for $63 million.

     In July 2001,  our Company  and San Miguel  acquired  CCBPI from  Coca-Cola
Amatil. Upon the completion of this transaction, our Company owned 35 percent of
the common  shares and 100  percent of the  Preferred  B shares,  and San Miguel
owned 65  percent of the common  shares of CCBPI.  Additionally,  as a result of
this  transaction,  our Company's  interest in Coca-Cola Amatil was reduced from
approximately 38 percent to approximately 35 percent.

     In  December  2001,  our  Company  completed  a cash  tender  offer for all
outstanding  shares of the common stock of Odwalla,  Inc. This  acquisition  was
valued at  approximately  $190 million  with our Company  receiving an ownership
interest of 100 percent.

     During  the first  half of 2001,  in  separate  transactions,  our  Company
purchased two bottlers in Brazil: Refrescos Guararapes Ltda. and Sucovalle Sucos
e Concentrados  do Vale S.A. In separate  transactions  during the first half of
2000, our Company  purchased two other bottlers in Brazil:  Companhia Mineira de
Refrescos,  S.A.  and  Refrigerantes  Minas Gerais Ltda.  In October  2000,  the
Company purchased a 58 percent interest in Paraguay Refrescos S.A.  (Paresa),  a
bottler in Paraguay.  In December  2000, the Company made a tender offer for the
remaining 42 percent of the shares in Paresa.  In January  2001,  following  the
completion of the tender offer, we owned approximately 95 percent of Paresa.

     The  acquisitions  and  investments  have been  accounted for by either the
purchase or equity method of accounting, as appropriate. Their results have been
included in our financial  statements from their respective dates of acquisition
using the appropriate method of accounting.  Had the results of these businesses
been included in operations commencing with 2000, the reported results would not
have been materially affected.

NOTE 19: SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

During the first quarter of 2003, the Company  initiated steps to streamline and
simplify its operations, primarily in North America and Germany.

     In North America,  the Company is  integrating  the operations of our three
separate North American  business units- Coca-Cola North America  (including our
interest in CCDA), The Minute Maid Company  (including our Odwalla business) and
Fountain.  The  integration  is expected to result in a headcount  reduction  of
approximately 1,000 people, with the identification of the individuals  expected
to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2003.

     In  Germany,  CCEAG  has taken  steps to  improve  efficiency  in sales and
distribution, including the closure of three

bottling  plants in 2003.  The  streamlining  initiative  is  expected to affect
approximately 900 employees in Germany.

NOTE 20: OPERATING SEGMENTS

Our Company's  operating  structure includes the following  operating  segments:
North America (including The Minute Maid Company);  Africa;  Europe, Eurasia and
Middle East;  Latin America;  Asia; and  Corporate.  North America  includes the
United  States,  Canada and Puerto Rico.  During the first quarter of 2002,  the
Egypt Region was  reclassified  from Europe,  Eurasia and Middle East to Africa.
Prior period  amounts have been  reclassified  to conform to the current  period
presentation.

     Effective   January  1,  2001,  our  Company's   operating   segments  were
geographically  reconfigured and renamed. Puerto Rico was added to North America
from Latin  America.  The Middle East  Division was added to Europe and Eurasia,
which  changed its name to Europe,  Eurasia and Middle  East.  At the same time,
Africa and Middle East, less the reclassified Middle East Division,  changed its
name to Africa. During the first quarter of 2001, Asia Pacific was renamed Asia.
Prior period  amounts have been  reclassified  to conform to the current  period
presentation.

Segment Products and Services
- -----------------------------
The business of our Company is nonalcoholic  beverages.  Our operating  segments
derive  substantially  all of their  revenues from the  manufacture  and sale of
beverage  concentrates  and  syrups,  and in some  cases,  the sale of  finished
beverages.  The Net Operating  Revenues from operations  excluding bottling were
$17,157  million,  $16,402 million and $16,448  million,  respectively,  for the
years  ended  December  31,  2002,  2001 and  2000.  Our  consolidated  bottling
operations  accounted  for Net  Operating  Revenues  of $2,407  million,  $1,143
million and $906 million,  respectively,  for the years ended December 31, 2002,
2001 and 2000.

Method of Determining Segment Profit or Loss
- --------------------------------------------
Management  evaluates the  performance of its operating  segments  separately to
individually  monitor the different  factors  affecting  financial  performance.
Segment  profit  or loss  includes  substantially  all the  segment's  costs  of
production,  distribution and administration.  Our Company typically manages and
evaluates equity investments and related income on a segment level.  However, we
manage  certain  significant  investments,  such  as  our  equity  interests  in
Coca-Cola  Enterprises,  at the Corporate  segment.  Our Company  manages income
taxes on a global basis. We manage financial  costs,  such as exchange gains and
losses and  interest  income and  expense,  on a global  basis at the  Corporate
segment.  Thus, we evaluate segment  performance  based on profit or loss before
income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHARE OWNERS
THE COCA-COLA COMPANY

We have audited the  accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets of The Coca-Cola
Company  and  subsidiaries  as of December  31,  2002 and 2001,  and the related
consolidated statements of income, share-owners' equity, and cash flows for each
of the three  years in the period  ended  December  31,  2002.  These  financial
statements   are  the   responsibility   of  the   Company's   management.   Our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based on
our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance  with  auditing  standards  generally
accepted in the United States.  Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An
audit also includes  assessing the accounting  principles  used and  significant
estimates  made by  management,  as well as  evaluating  the  overall  financial
statement  presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable  basis
for our opinion.

     In our opinion,  the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects,  the consolidated  financial position of The Coca-Cola
Company and  subsidiaries  at December 31, 2002 and 2001,  and the  consolidated
results of their  operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended  December 31, 2002, in conformity  with  accounting  principles
generally accepted in the United States.

     As discussed in Notes 1, 4 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
in 2002 the Company  changed its method of  accounting  for  goodwill  and other
intangible   assets  and  changed  its  method  of  accounting  for  stock-based
compensation.  As  discussed  in  Notes 1 and 10 to the  Consolidated  Financial
Statements,  in 2001 the Company changed its method of accounting for derivative
instruments and hedging activities.

Effective January 1, 2002, our Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards  (SFAS) No.  142,  "Goodwill  and Other  Intangible  Assets."  For the
Company's  intangible assets, the cumulative effect of this change in accounting
principle  was a decrease to net income after taxes in the first quarter of 2002
of  approximately  $367 million  ($.15 per share after income  taxes,  basic and
diluted). For the Company's  proportionate share of its equity method investees,
the cumulative  effect of this change in accounting  principle was a decrease to
net  income  after  taxes in the first  quarter  of 2002 of  approximately  $559
million ($.22 per share after income taxes, basic and diluted). Refer to Note 4.

     Effective  January 1, 2002, our Company  adopted the preferable  fair value
recognition   provisions   of  SFAS  No.  123,   "Accounting   for   Stock-Based
Compensation." Our Company selected the modified  prospective method of adoption
as    described    in   SFAS    No.    148,    "Accounting    for    Stock-Based
Compensation--Transition and  Disclosure."  Since  SFAS No.  148 was  issued  in
December  2002,  results  for  the  quarters  previously  reported  in our  2002
Quarterly  Reports on Form 10-Q were restated to the amounts noted above for the
modified  prospective  method of  adoption.  The pretax  impact of adopting  the
provisions  under the  modified  prospective  method for the three  months ended
March 31, 2002, June 30, 2002,  September 30, 2002 and December 31, 2002 was $95
million, $92 million, $95 million and $91 million,  respectively.  The 2002 full
year impact of adopting the provisions under the modified prospective method was
$.11 per share after income  taxes,  basic and diluted.  Results for prior years
have not been restated. Refer to Note 1.

     Effective  January 1, 2002, our Company  adopted the provisions of Emerging
Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 01-9,  "Accounting for Consideration Given by
a Vendor to a Customer or a Reseller of the Vendor's Products." Refer to Note 1.
The adoption of the remaining  items included in EITF Issue No. 01-9 resulted in
the Company reducing Net Operating Revenues by $520 million,  $641 million, $701
million and $685  million,  respectively,  for the three  months ended March 31,
2001,   June  30,  2001,   September  30,  2001  and  December  31,  2001.  This
reclassification had no impact on Operating Income.

     The first quarter of 2002 includes a noncash pretax charge of approximately
$157 million  ($.06 per share after income taxes,  basic and diluted)  primarily
related to the write-down of our investments in Latin America.

     In the first quarter of 2002,  Cervejarias  Kaiser S.A. sold its investment
in  Cervejarias  Kaiser  Brazil,  Ltda  to  Molson  Inc.  (Molson)  for  cash of
approximately  $485 million and shares of Molson  valued at  approximately  $150
million.  Our  Company's  pretax  share of the  gain  related  to this  sale was
approximately  $43  million  ($.01  per  share  after  income  taxes,  basic and
diluted).

     The third quarter of 2002 includes a noncash pretax charge of approximately
$33 million  ($.01 per share after income taxes,  basic and diluted)  related to
our proportionate share of impairment and restructuring charges taken by certain
investees in Latin America.

     The third  quarter of 2001 includes a noncash gain on the issuance of stock
by one of our equity  investees,  Coca-Cola  Enterprises,  of approximately  $91
million ($.02 per share after income taxes, basic and diluted).

<DESCRIPTION>CAUTIONARY STATEMENT RELATING TO FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
<TEXT>
                                                                  EXHIBIT 99.1

          CAUTIONARY STATEMENT RELATIVE TO FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Certain written and oral statements made by our Company and subsidiaries or with
the approval of an authorized executive officer of our Company may constitute
"forward-looking statements" as defined under the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995, including statements made in this report and other filings
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Generally, the words "believe,"
"expect," "intend," "estimate," "anticipate," "project," "will" and similar
expressions identify forward-looking statements, which generally are not
historical in nature. All statements which address operating performance, events
or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future --
including statements relating to volume growth, share of sales and earnings per
share growth and statements expressing general optimism about future operating
results -- are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are
subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to
differ materially from our Company's historical experience and our present
expectations or projections. As and when made, management believes that these
forward-looking statements are reasonable. However, caution should be taken not
to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements since such
statements speak only as of the date when made. The Company undertakes no
obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether
as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

  The following are some of the factors that could cause our Company's actual
results to differ materially from the expected results described in or
underlying our Company's forward-looking statements:

     *  Economic and political conditions, especially in international markets,
        including civil unrest, product boycotts, governmental changes and
        restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders. Without
        limiting the preceding sentence, the current unstable economic and
        political conditions and civil unrest in the Middle East, Brazil and
        Venezuela, potential or actual conflicts in Iraq, North Korea or
        elsewhere, or the continuation or escalation of terrorism, could have
        adverse impacts on our Company's business results or financial
        condition.

     *  Changes in the nonalcoholic beverages business environment. These
        include, without limitation, changes in consumer preferences,
        competitive product and pricing pressures and our ability to gain or
        maintain share of sales in the global market as a result of actions by
        competitors. Factors such as these could impact our earnings, share of
        sales and volume growth.

     *  Foreign currency rate fluctuations, interest rate fluctuations and other
        capital market conditions. Most of our exposures to capital markets,
        including foreign currency and interest rates, are managed on a
        consolidated basis, which allows us to net certain exposures and, thus,
        take advantage of any natural offsets. We use derivative financial
        instruments to reduce our net exposure to financial risks. There can be
        no assurance, however, that our financial risk management program will
        be successful in reducing capital market exposures.

     *  Adverse weather conditions, which could reduce demand for Company
        products.

     *  The effectiveness of our advertising, marketing and promotional
        programs.

     *  Fluctuations in the cost and availability of raw materials and the
        ability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships.

     *  Our ability to achieve earnings forecasts, which are generated based on
        projected volumes and sales of many product types, some of which are
        more profitable than others. There can be no assurance that we will
        achieve the projected level or mix of product sales.

     *  Changes in laws and regulations, including changes in accounting
        standards, taxation requirements (including tax rate changes, new tax
        laws and revised tax law interpretations), competition laws and
        environmental laws in domestic or foreign jurisdictions.

     *  Our ability to penetrate developing and emerging markets, which also
        depends on economic and political conditions, and how well we are able
        to acquire or form strategic business alliances with local bottlers and
        make necessary infrastructure enhancements to production facilities,
        distribution networks, sales equipment and technology. Moreover, the
        supply of products in developing markets must match the customers'
        demand for those products, and due to product price and cultural
        differences, there can be no assurance of product acceptance in any
        particular market.

     *  The uncertainties of litigation, as well as other risks and
        uncertainties detailed from time to time in our Company's Securities and
        Exchange Commission filings.


 The foregoing list of important factors is not exclusive.
