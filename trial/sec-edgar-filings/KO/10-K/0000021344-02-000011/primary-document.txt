                                     PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS
----------------
     The Coca-Cola  Company  (together with its  subsidiaries,  the "Company" or
"our Company") was incorporated in September 1919 under the laws of the State of
Delaware and  succeeded to the business of a Georgia  corporation  with the same
name  that had been  organized  in 1892.  Our  Company  is the  world's  leading
manufacturer, distributor and marketer of nonalcoholic beverage concentrates and
syrups.  We  manufacture  beverage  concentrates  and  syrups  and,  in  certain
instances, finished beverages, which we sell to bottling and canning operations,
fountain  wholesalers and some fountain  retailers.  Finished  beverage products
bearing the Company's trademarks,  sold in the United States since 1886, are now
sold in nearly 200 countries and include the leading soft drink products in most
of  these  countries.  The  Company  also  markets  and  distributes  juice  and
juice-drink  products.  In  addition,  we have  ownership  interests in numerous
bottling and canning operations.

     Our  Company is one of numerous  competitors  in the  commercial  beverages
market.  Of the approximately 48 billion beverage servings of all types consumed
worldwide  every day,  beverages  bearing  the  Company's  trademarks  ("Company
Trademark Beverages") account for more than 1.1 billion.

     The business of our Company is  nonalcoholic  beverages - principally  soft
drinks but also a variety of  noncarbonated  beverages.  As used in this report,
the term "soft drinks" refers to nonalcoholic  carbonated  beverages  containing
flavorings and sweeteners,  excluding waters,  flavored waters and carbonated or
noncarbonated teas, coffees and sports drinks.

     Our Company  believes  that our  success  depends on our ability to connect
with  consumers  by creating  brands they love,  and the capacity of our people,
together with our bottling  partners,  to find new and appealing ways to deliver
those brands to thirsty people everywhere.  To this end, the Company has adopted
an approach to its business that is based on the following objectives:

     - Accelerate carbonated soft-drink growth, led by Coca-Cola
     - Selectively broaden our family of beverage brands to drive profitable
        growth
     - Grow system profitability and capability together with our bottling
        partners
     - Serve customers with creativity and consistency to generate growth across
        all channels
     - Direct investments to highest potential areas across markets
     - Drive efficiency and cost-effectiveness everywhere

     The  Company's   operating   structure  includes  the  following  operating
segments:  North America  (including The Minute Maid Company);  Africa;  Europe,
Eurasia and Middle East; Latin America;  Asia; and Corporate.  This structure is
the basis for our  Company's  internal  financial  reporting.  The North America
segment includes the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. Effective January 1,
2001, the Company's  operating  segments were  geographically  reconfigured  and
renamed as follows:  Puerto Rico was added to the North America segment from the
Latin  America  segment.  The Middle East  Division  was added to the Europe and
Eurasia segment,  which changed its name to the Europe,  Eurasia and Middle East
segment. At the same time the Africa and Middle East segment, less the relocated
Middle East Division,  changed its name to the Africa segment.  During the first
quarter of 2001, the Asia Pacific segment was renamed the Asia segment.

     In  March  2001,  our  Company  announced  a  new  operational   management
structure.   Four  strategic  business  units  were  created:   Americas,  Asia,
Europe/Africa, and Coca-Cola Ventures. In July 2001, this structure was modified
to comprise a total of four strategic  business units:  Americas;  Asia; Europe,
Eurasia and Middle East; and Coca-Cola Ventures;  as well as a separate business
unit: the Africa Group. Coca-Cola Ventures (including, for operational reporting
purposes,  The Minute Maid Company) is a strategic business unit responsible for
identifying and developing significant new business opportunities,  managing our
Company's  interests  in  noncarbonated  beverage  new  businesses  and ventures
worldwide,  and  coordinating and overseeing  unconsolidated  joint ventures and
partnerships.  These  responsibilities  are  shared  jointly  between  Coca-Cola
Ventures  and  operating   management  of  the  Company's  applicable  operating
segments. The financial results of these businesses,  ventures, and


                                       1
<PAGE>

partnerships are included in the financial results of the applicable  geographic
operating segments. Consequently, the Coca-Cola Ventures strategic business unit
is not  considered  an  operating  segment with profit and loss  statements  and
separate, identifiable assets.

     At the date of this report,  the heads of the strategic  business units are
as follows:  Jeffrey T. Dunn (Americas),  Mary E. Minnick (Asia), A.R.C. "Sandy"
Allan  (Europe,  Eurasia  and  Middle  East),  and  Steven J.  Heyer  (Coca-Cola
Ventures).  See "Item X. --  Executive  Officers of the  Company."  Alexander B.
Cummings,  Jr. is the head of the  Africa  Group.  Steven J.  Heyer  reports  to
Douglas N. Daft,  Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer
of the Company.  The other executives named above report to Brian G. Dyson, Vice
Chairman and Chief Operating Officer of the Company.

     Except to the  extent  that  differences  between  operating  segments  are
material to an  understanding  of our Company's  business taken as a whole,  the
description  of  the  Company's  business  in  this  report  is  presented  on a
consolidated basis.

     In the following table,  prior period amounts have been restated to conform
to the current period presentation.  Of the Company's consolidated net operating
revenues and operating  income for each of the past three years,  the percentage
represented by each operating segment (excluding Corporate) is as follows:

For additional financial  information about the Company's operating segments and
geographic  areas,  see  Notes  1,  14  and  19 to  the  Consolidated  Financial
Statements,  set forth on pages  62-64,  77-78 and 81-83,  respectively,  of the
Company's  Annual  Report to Share Owners for the year ended  December 31, 2001,
incorporated herein by reference.

     Our Company  manufactures and sells soft drink and  noncarbonated  beverage
concentrates and syrups, including fountain syrups, some finished beverages, and
certain juice and juice-drink products. Syrups are composed of sweetener,  water
and flavoring  concentrate.  The  concentrates and syrups for bottled and canned
beverages are sold by the Company to authorized bottling and canning operations.
The bottlers or canners of soft-drink  products  either  combine  the syrup with
carbonated water or combine the concentrate with sweetener, water and carbonated
water to produce finished soft drinks.  The finished soft drinks are packaged in
authorized  containers bearing our Company's  trademarks - cans,  refillable and
non-refillable  glass and plastic  bottles - for sale to  retailers  or, in some
cases,  wholesalers.  Fountain syrups are  manufactured and sold by the Company,
principally in the United States,  to authorized  fountain  wholesalers and some
fountain  retailers.  (Outside the United States,  fountain syrups typically are
manufactured  by  authorized  bottlers  from  concentrates  sold  to them by the
Company.)   Authorized  fountain   wholesalers   (including  certain  authorized
bottlers) sell fountain syrups to fountain retailers. The fountain retailers use
dispensing  equipment to mix the syrup with  carbonated  or still water and then
sell  finished soft drinks or  noncarbonated  beverages to consumers in cups and
glasses.  Finished  beverages  manufactured  by our  Company  are  sold by it to
authorized  bottlers  or  distributors,  who in  turn  sell  these  products  to
retailers or, in some cases, wholesalers. Both directly and through a network of
business   partners  that  includes  certain  Coca-Cola   bottlers,   juice  and
juice-drink  products  manufactured  by the  Company  are sold by our Company to
retailers and wholesalers in the United States and numerous other countries.

     The Company's  beverage  products,  including  bottled and canned beverages
produced by independent and Company-owned  bottling and canning  operations,  as
well as concentrates and syrups, include Coca-Cola,  Coca-Cola classic, caffeine
free  Coca-Cola,  caffeine  free  Coca-Cola  classic,  diet Coke (sold under the
trademark  Coca-Cola  light in many  countries  other than the  United  States),
caffeine free diet Coke,  diet Coke with lemon,  Cherry Coke,  diet Cherry Coke,
Fanta brand soft drinks,  Sprite,  diet Sprite (sold under the trademark  Sprite

Minute Maid flavors, Aquarius, Sokenbicha, Ciel, Bonaqa, Dasani, Lift, Thums Up,
Kuat, Qoo and other products developed for specific countries, including Georgia
brand  ready-to-drink  coffees,  and numerous  other brands.  In many  countries
(excluding the United States, among others) our Company's beverage products also
include  Schweppes,  Canada Dry, Dr Pepper and Crush. The Minute Maid Company, a
global  division  with  operations  primarily  in the United  States and Canada,
produces,  distributes and markets  principally juice and juice-drink  products,
including Minute Maid products, Simply Orange orange juice, Odwalla and Samantha
super  premium  juices and drinks,  Five Alive  refreshment  beverages,  Bacardi
tropical fruit mixers  (manufactured and marketed under a license from Bacardi &
Company Limited), and Hi-C ready-to-serve fruit drinks.  Additionally,  Beverage
Partners  Worldwide,  the  Company's  joint  venture  with Nestle S.A.,  markets
ready-to-drink teas and coffees in certain countries.

     Consumer demand  determines the optimal menu of Company product  offerings.
Consumer  demand can vary from one locale to  another  and can change  over time
within a single locale.  Employing our business strategy, and with special focus
on Coca-Cola,  our Company  seeks to build its existing  brands and, at the same
time, to broaden its historical family of brands, products and services in order
to create and satisfy consumer demand locale by locale.

     Our Company  introduced a variety of new brands and acquired  brands during
2001. Diet Coke with lemon was rolled out initially in the United States, Canada
and Puerto Rico,  commencing in  September.  In July,  our Company  introduced a
reformulated POWERade,  including B vitamins, as a family of drinks that combine
the benefits of energy and hydration. Other product introductions included:

     - Simply  Orange,  a  not-from-concentrate  premium  orange  juice from The
        Minute Maid Company
     - U.S. rollout of Minute Maid Lemonade and Minute Maid Fruit Punch
     - The juice drink, Qoo, in Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan
     - Joy, a bottled drinking water, and the energy drink Samurai in Vietnam
     - Marocha Green Tea in Japan
     - Lan Feng, a bottled green tea beverage, in China

     Also during 2001, our Company teamed with The Walt Disney Company to market
innovative  children's   beverages.   The  first  products  launched  under  the
multi-year  agreement are from The Minute Maid Company in the United States, and
include the DISNEY XTREME!  COOLERS(tm)  line, a fortified  juice drink with 25%
less  sugar  than the  average of leading  kids'  juice  drinks,  and the DISNEY
HUNDRED ACRE WOOD(tm) 100% JUICE line, fortified with Vitamin C and Calcium.

     In 2001  concentrates  and  syrups  for  beverages  bearing  the  trademark
"Coca-Cola" or including the trademark "Coke" accounted for approximately 60% of
the Company's total gallon sales.(1)

--------------

(1) Our  Company  measures  sales  volume in two ways:  (1) gallons and (2) unit
cases of finished products. "Gallons" is a unit of measurement for concentrates,
syrups and other beverage  products  (expressed in equivalent  gallons of syrup)
included by the Company in unit case volume.  Most of the Company's revenues are
based on this  measure of  primarily  "wholesale"  activity.  Our  Company  also
measures volume in unit cases. As used in this report,  "unit case" means a unit
of  measurement  equal  to 192  U.S.  fluid  ounces  of  finished  beverage  (24
eight-ounce servings); and "unit case volume" of the Company means the number of
unit cases (or unit case  equivalents) of Company trademark or licensed beverage
products directly or indirectly sold by the Coca-Cola  bottling system or by the
Company  to  customers,  including  (i)  beverage  products  bearing  trademarks
licensed to the Company and (ii) certain key products  (which are not  material)
owned by Coca-Cola system bottlers and for which the Company provides  marketing
support and derives profit from the sales.

                                       3

<PAGE>



     In  2001,  gallon  sales  in  the  United  States  ("U.S.   gallon  sales")
represented   approximately  28%  of  the  Company's   worldwide  gallon  sales.
Approximately  60% of U.S.  gallon sales for 2001 was  attributable  to sales of
beverage   concentrates  and  syrups  to  approximately  82  authorized  bottler
ownership  groups in  approximately  394 licensed  territories.  Those  bottlers
prepare and sell finished  beverages  bearing the Company's  trademarks  for the
food store and vending machine distribution  channels and for other distribution
channels  supplying home and immediate  consumption.  Approximately  34% of 2001
U.S. gallon sales was attributable to fountain syrups sold to fountain retailers
and to  approximately  500  authorized  fountain  wholesalers,  some of whom are
authorized  bottlers.  These  fountain  wholesalers  in turn sell the  syrups or
deliver  them  on  the  Company's  behalf  to  restaurants  and  other  fountain
retailers.  The  remaining  approximately  6% of  2001  U.S.  gallon  sales  was
attributable to juice and juice- drink products sold by The Minute Maid Company.
Coca-Cola  Enterprises Inc.,  including its bottling  subsidiaries and divisions
("Coca-Cola Enterprises"), accounted for approximately 52% of the Company's U.S.
gallon  sales in 2001.  At December  31,  2001,  our Company  held an  ownership
interest of  approximately  38% in Coca-Cola  Enterprises,  which is the world's
largest bottler of Company Trademark Beverages.

     In 2001, gallon sales outside the United States  represented  approximately
72% of the Company's  worldwide  gallon sales. In 2001, our Company's  principal
markets outside the United States,  based on gallon sales, were Mexico,  Brazil,
Japan  and  Germany,  which  together  accounted  for  approximately  25% of the
Company's worldwide gallon sales. Approximately 90% of non-U.S. unit case volume
for 2001 was  attributable  to sales of  beverage  concentrates  and  syrups  to
authorized bottlers in approximately 478 licensed territories.  Approximately 7%
of 2001  non-U.S.  unit case volume was  attributable  to fountain  syrups.  The
remaining approximately 3% of 2001 non-U.S. unit case volume was attributable to
juice and juice-drink products.

     In addition to conducting  its own  independent  advertising  and marketing
activities,  our Company may provide  promotional and marketing  services and/or
funds and consultation to its bottlers and to fountain and bottle/can retailers,
usually but not always on a discretionary  basis. Also on a discretionary basis,
in most cases, the Company may develop and introduce new products,  packages and
equipment  to assist its  bottlers,  fountain  syrup  wholesalers  and  fountain
beverage retailers.

     The  profitability  of our Company's  business outside the United States is
subject to many factors,  including  governmental trade regulations and monetary
policies,  economic  and  political  conditions  in the  countries in which such
business is  conducted  and the risk of changes in currency  exchange  rates and
regulations.

     BOTTLER'S AGREEMENTS AND DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS

     Separate contracts ("Bottler's Agreements") between our Company and each of
its bottlers  regarding  the  manufacture  and sale of soft  drinks,  subject to
specified terms and conditions and certain  variations,  generally authorize the
bottler to prepare particular designated Company Trademark Beverages, to package
the same in particular  authorized  containers,  and to distribute  and sell the
same  in (but  generally  only  in) an  identified  territory.  The  bottler  is
obligated to purchase its entire  requirement of  concentrates or syrups for the
designated  Company Trademark  Beverages from the Company or  Company-authorized
suppliers.  Our Company typically agrees to refrain from selling or distributing
or from authorizing  third parties to sell or distribute the designated  Company
Trademark  Beverages  throughout  the  identified  territory  in the  particular
authorized containers; however, the Company typically reserves for itself or its
designee the right (i) to prepare and package such beverages in such  containers
in the territory  for sale outside the  territory and (ii) to prepare,  package,
distribute and sell such beverages in the territory in any other manner or form.

     The Bottler's Agreements between our Company and its authorized bottlers in
the United States differ in certain  respects from those in the other  countries
in which Company  Trademark  Beverages are sold. As hereinafter  discussed,  the
principal  differences involve the duration of the agreements;  the inclusion or
exclusion of canned beverage  production  rights;  the inclusion or exclusion of
authorizations to manufacture and distribute fountain syrups; in some cases, the
degree of  flexibility  on the part of the Company to  determine  the pricing of
syrups and concentrates;  and the extent, if any, of the Company's obligation to
provide marketing support.


     OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. The Bottler's Agreements between our Company and
its  authorized  bottlers  outside  the United  States  generally  are of stated
duration,  subject in some cases to possible  extensions or renewals of the term
of the contract.  Generally,  these  contracts are subject to termination by the
Company following the occurrence

                                       4

<PAGE>

of certain  designated  events,  including defined events of default and certain
changes in ownership or control of the bottler.

     In certain  parts of the world outside the United  States,  the Company has
not granted  comprehensive  beverage production rights to the bottlers.  In such
instances,  our Company or its designee typically sells canned (or in some cases
bottled) Company  Trademark  Beverages to the bottlers for sale and distribution
throughout the designated  territory under distribution  agreements,  often on a
non-exclusive basis. A majority of the Bottler's Agreements in force between the
Company  and  bottlers  outside  the  United  States  authorize  the  bottler to
manufacture and distribute fountain syrups, usually on a non-exclusive basis.

     Our Company  generally has complete  flexibility to determine the price and
other terms of sale of  concentrates  and syrups to bottlers  outside the United
States and,  although in its  discretion  it may determine to do so, the Company
typically (but not always) has no obligation under such Bottler's  Agreements to
provide  marketing support to the bottlers.  In some instances,  the Company has
agreed or may in the future agree with the bottler  with respect to  concentrate
pricing on a prospective basis for specified time periods.

     WITHIN THE UNITED STATES.  In the United States,  with certain very limited
exceptions,  the Bottler's  Agreements  for  Coca-Cola  and other  cola-flavored
beverages have no stated expiration date and the contracts for other flavors are
of stated duration,  subject to bottler renewal rights. The Bottler's Agreements
in  the  United   States  are  subject  to   termination   by  the  Company  for
nonperformance or upon the occurrence of certain defined events of default which
may vary from contract to contract. The hereinafter described "1987 Contract" is
terminable by the Company upon the occurrence of certain events  including:  (1)
the  bottler's  insolvency,  dissolution,  receivership  or the  like;  (2)  any
disposition by the bottler or any of its  subsidiaries of any voting  securities
of any bottler subsidiary  without the consent of the Company;  (3) any material
breach of any obligation of the bottler under the 1987  Contract;  or (4) except
in the case of certain  bottlers,  if a person or affiliated  group  acquires or
obtains any right to acquire beneficial  ownership of more than 10% of any class
or series of voting  securities  of the  bottler  without  authorization  by the
Company.

     Under the terms of the Bottler's Agreements,  bottlers in the United States
are authorized to  manufacture  and distribute  Company  Trademark  Beverages in
bottles and cans,  but generally  are not  authorized  to  manufacture  fountain
syrups.   Rather,  our  Company   manufactures  and  sells  fountain  syrups  to
approximately 500 authorized fountain wholesalers  (including certain authorized
bottlers) and some fountain  retailers.  The wholesalers in turn sell the syrups
or deliver them on the Company's behalf to restaurants and other retailers.  The
wholesaler  typically  acts pursuant to a  non-exclusive  letter of  appointment
which neither  restricts  the pricing of fountain  syrups by our Company nor the
territory in which the wholesaler may resell in the United States.

     In the United  States,  the form of Bottler's  Agreement for  cola-flavored
soft drinks that covers the largest amount of U.S. volume (the "1987  Contract")
gives the Company complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of
sale of soft drink  concentrates and syrups for cola-flavored  Company Trademark
Beverages   ("Coca-Cola   Trademark  Beverages")  and  other  Company  Trademark
Beverages. In some instances,  the Company has agreed or may in the future agree
with the bottler with respect to concentrate  pricing on a prospective basis for
specified time periods. Bottlers operating under the 1987 Contract accounted for
approximately  85% of our Company's total United States gallon sales for bottled
and canned  beverages,  excluding juice and  juice-drink  products of The Minute
Maid Company,  ("U.S.  bottle/can gallon sales") in 2001. Certain other forms of
the U.S. Bottler's Agreement, entered into prior to 1987, provide for soft drink
concentrates or syrups for certain  Coca-Cola  Trademark  Beverages to be priced
pursuant to a stated  formula.  The oldest such form of contract,  applicable to
bottlers  accounting for  approximately  1% of U.S.  bottle/can  gallon sales in
2001,  provides for a fixed price for Coca-Cola  syrup used in bottles and cans,
subject  to  quarterly  adjustments  to reflect  changes in the quoted  price of
sugar.  Bottlers  accounting  for  the  remaining   approximately  14%  of  U.S.
bottle/can gallon sales in 2001 have contracts for certain  Coca-Cola  Trademark
Beverages with pricing  formulas  generally  providing for a baseline price that
may be adjusted  periodically  by the Company,  up to a maximum  indexed ceiling
price,  and that is adjusted  quarterly  based upon changes in certain  sugar or
sweetener prices, as applicable.

     Standard  contracts  with  bottlers  in the  United  States for the sale of
concentrates  and syrups for non-cola-flavored soft drinks in bottles  and  cans
permit flexible pricing by the Company.

                                       5

     Under the 1987 Contract,  our Company has no obligation to participate with
bottlers  in  expenditures  for  advertising  and  marketing,  but  may,  at its
discretion,  contribute  toward such  expenditures and undertake  independent or
cooperative advertising and marketing activities. Some U.S. Bottler's Agreements
that pre-date the 1987 Contract  impose  certain  marketing  obligations  on the
Company with respect to certain Company Trademark Beverages.

     SIGNIFICANT EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND COMPANY BOTTLING OPERATIONS

     Our Company maintains business  relationships with three types of bottlers:
(1)  independently  owned  bottlers,  in  which  the  Company  has no  ownership
interest;   (2)   bottlers  in  which  the  Company  has   invested  and  has  a
noncontrolling  ownership  interest;  and (3)  bottlers in which the Company has
invested and has a controlling ownership interest. In 2001,  independently owned
bottling operations produced and distributed  approximately 23% of the Company's
worldwide unit case volume; cost or equity method investee bottlers in which the
Company  owns a  noncontrolling  ownership  interest  produced  and  distributed
approximately  61% of such  worldwide  unit  case  volume;  and  controlled  and
consolidated  bottling  and  fountain  operations,  including  The  Minute  Maid
Company,  produced and distributed approximately 16% of such worldwide unit case
volume.

     Our Company makes equity  investments in selected bottling  operations with
the  intention  of  maximizing  the  strength and  efficiency  of the  Coca-Cola
business  system's  production,  distribution  and marketing  systems around the
world.  These  investments  are  intended  to result in  increases  in unit case
volume,  net revenues and profits at the bottler  level,  which in turn generate
increased gallon sales for the Company's concentrate business. When this occurs,
both the Company  and the  bottlers  benefit  from  long-term  growth in volume,
improved cash flows and increased share-owner value.

     The level of our Company's  investment  generally  depends on the bottler's
capital  structure  and its available  resources at the time of the  investment.
Historically,  in certain situations,  the Company has viewed it as advantageous
to acquire a controlling interest in a bottling operation,  often on a temporary
basis. Owning such a controlling  interest has allowed the Company to compensate
for  limited  local  resources  and has  enabled  the  Company to help focus the
bottler's  sales and  marketing  programs and assist in the  development  of the
bottler's business and information  systems and the establishment of appropriate
capital structures.

     In line with its  long-term  bottling  strategy,  our Company  periodically
considers  options for reducing its  ownership  interest in a bottler.  One such
option  is to  combine  the  Company's  bottling  interests  with  the  bottling
interests of others to form strategic business  alliances.  Another option is to
sell the  Company's  interest in a bottling  operation  to one of the  Company's
equity investee bottlers. In both of these situations,  our Company continues to
participate  in the  bottler's  results of  operations  through its share of the
equity investee's earnings or losses.

     In  cases  where  the   Company's   investments   in   bottlers   represent
noncontrolling  interests,  our Company's  intention is to provide expertise and
resources to strengthen those businesses.

     Our Company has substantial equity positions in 56 unconsolidated bottling,
canning  and  distribution  operations  for its  products  worldwide,  including
bottlers  representing  approximately  57% of the Company's total U.S. unit case
volume in 2001. Of these,  significant  investee  bottlers  accounted for by the
equity method include the following:

     COCA-COLA  ENTERPRISES INC. Our Company's  ownership  interest in Coca-Cola
Enterprises was approximately 38% at December 31, 2001. Coca-Cola Enterprises is
the world's largest  bottler of the Company's  beverage  products.  In 2001, net
sales of concentrates  and syrups by the Company to Coca-Cola  Enterprises  were
approximately $3.9 billion,  or approximately 19% of our Company's net operating
revenues.  Coca-Cola Enterprises also purchases high-fructose corn syrup through
the  Company;  however,  related  collections  from  Coca-Cola  Enterprises  and
payments to suppliers are not included in the Company's consolidated  statements
of income.  Coca-Cola  Enterprises  estimates  that the  territories in which it
markets beverage  products to retailers (which include portions of 46 states and
the District of Columbia in the U.S., Canada, Great Britain, continental France,
the Netherlands,  Luxembourg,  Belgium and Monaco) contain  approximately 79% of
the United States  population,  98% of the population of Canada, and 100% of the
populations of Great Britain,  continental France, the Netherlands,  Luxembourg,
Belgium and Monaco.

                                       6

     Excluding products in post-mix (fountain) form, in 2001,  approximately 61%
of the unit  case  volume  of  Coca-Cola  Enterprises  was  Coca-Cola  Trademark
Beverages, approximately 31% of its unit case volume was other Company Trademark
Beverages, and approximately 8% of its unit case volume was beverage products of
other   companies.   Coca-Cola   Enterprises'   net   operating   revenues  were
approximately $15.7 billion in 2001.

     COCA-COLA HBC S.A.  ("COCA-COLA  HBC"). At December 31, 2001, our Company's
ownership  interest in Coca-Cola HBC was  approximately  24%.  Coca-Cola HBC has
bottling and distribution rights, through direct ownership or joint ventures, in
Armenia, Austria, Belarus, Bosnia, Bulgaria,  Croatia, Czech Republic,  Estonia,
Greece,  Hungary,  Latvia,  Lithuania,  Northern  Ireland,  Republic of Ireland,
Italy, Macedonia, Moldova, Nigeria, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia,
Switzerland,   Ukraine  and   Yugoslavia.   Coca-Cola  HBC  estimates  that  the
territories in which it markets beverage  products contain  approximately 67% of
the population of Italy and 100% of the populations of the other countries named
above in which Coca-Cola HBC has bottling and distribution rights.

     In 2001,  Coca-Cola HBC's net sales of beverage products were approximately
U.S.$3.1  billion.  In  2001,  approximately  54% of the  unit  case  volume  of
Coca-Cola HBC was Coca-Cola Trademark  Beverages,  approximately 40% of its unit
case volume was other Company  Trademark  Beverages and  approximately 6% of its
unit case volume was beverage products of Coca-Cola HBC or other companies.

     COCA-COLA AMATIL LIMITED  ("COCA-COLA  AMATIL").  At December 31, 2001, our
Company's   ownership  interest  in  Coca-Cola  Amatil  was  approximately  35%.
Coca-Cola  Amatil is the largest bottler of the Company's  beverage  products in
Australia  and  also  has  bottling  and  distribution  rights,  through  direct
ownership or joint ventures, in New Zealand,  Fiji, Papua New Guinea,  Indonesia
and South Korea.  Coca-Cola  Amatil  estimates that the  territories in which it
markets  beverage  products  contain  approximately  99%  of the  population  of
Australia,  100% of the populations of New Zealand, Fiji and South Korea, 86% of
the population of Papua New Guinea and 98% of the population of Indonesia.

     In  2001,   Coca-Cola   Amatil's  net  sales  of  beverage   products  were
approximately  U.S.$1.9  billion.  In 2001,  approximately  60% of the unit case
volume of Coca-Cola Amatil was Coca-Cola Trademark Beverages,  approximately 30%
of its unit case volume was other Company Trademark Beverages,  approximately 5%
of  its  unit  case  volume  was  beverage  products  of  Coca-Cola  Amatil  and
approximately  5% of its  unit  case  volume  was  beverage  products  of  other
companies.

     PANAMERICAN BEVERAGES, INC. ("PANAMCO").  At December 31, 2001, our Company
owned an equity interest of approximately 25% in Panamco,  a Panamanian  holding
company with bottling  subsidiaries  operating in a substantial  part of central
Mexico (excluding  Mexico City);  greater Sao Paulo, Campinas,  Santos and Matto
Grosso do Sul, Brazil;  central  Guatemala;  most of Colombia;  and all of Costa
Rica,  Venezuela and Nicaragua.  Panamco estimates that the territories in which
it markets  beverage  products  contain  approximately  19% of the population of
Mexico, 16% of the population of Brazil, 94% of the population of Colombia,  47%
of the  population  of  Guatemala  and 100% of the  populations  of Costa  Rica,
Venezuela and Nicaragua.

     In 2001,  Panamco's  net  sales of  beverage  products  were  approximately
U.S.$2.7 billion. In 2001,  approximately 51% of the unit case volume of Panamco
was Coca-Cola Trademark Beverages, approximately 23% of its unit case volume was
other Company Trademark  Beverages and approximately 26% of its unit case volume
was beverage products of Panamco or other companies.

     COCA-COLA FEMSA, S.A. DE C.V.  ("COCA-COLA  FEMSA").  At December 31, 2001,
our Company owned a 30% equity  interest in Coca-Cola  FEMSA, a Mexican  holding
company  with  bottling   subsidiaries   in  the  Valley  of  Mexico,   Mexico's
southeastern  region  and  Greater  Buenos  Aires,  Argentina.  Coca-Cola  FEMSA
estimates that the  territories in which it markets  beverage  products  contain
approximately  30% of the  population  of Mexico  and  approximately  31% of the
population of Argentina.

     In  2001,   Coca-Cola   FEMSA's  net  sales  of  beverage   products   were
approximately  U.S.$1.9  billion.  In 2001,  approximately  74% of the unit case
volume of Coca-Cola FEMSA was Coca-Cola Trademark  Beverages,  approximately 26%
of its unit case volume was other Company  Trademark  Beverages and less than 1%
of its unit case  volume  was  beverage  products  of  Coca-Cola  FEMSA or other
companies.

                                       7

     OTHER  INTERESTS.  Our Company owns a 50% interest in a joint  venture with
Nestle S.A.  and  certain  of  its  subsidiaries   which  is  focused  upon  the
ready-to-drink tea and coffee businesses.  The joint venture currently has sales
in the United States and approximately 30 other countries.

     On January 30, 2001, our Company and Nestle S.A. announced plans to further
develop the joint  venture,  including by expanding  its scope to virtually  all
countries other than Japan, and to rename the joint venture  "Beverage  Partners
Worldwide"  ("BPW").   The  purpose  of  the  restructuring  was  to  create  an
entrepreneurial  unit  dedicated  to tapping  the growth  potential  of emerging
beverage  segments,  particularly  ready-to-drink  teas and  coffees and certain
beverages with a healthful positioning.

     Brands already within the joint venture  include Nestea and Nescafe for the
ready-to-drink  categories.  As a part of the  restructuring,  our Company is to
contribute to BPW the Planet Java coffee business,  the Mad River  noncarbonated
drink  business  and the Yang  Guang and Nagomi tea  businesses,  among  others.
Nestle will contribute its Belte tea business and certain other businesses.

     In March 2001,  our Company and Nestle S.A.  signed an amended and restated
shareholders   agreement  as  the  first  step  in   undertaking   the  proposed
restructuring.  In late  2001,  the  restructuring  was  granted  all  necessary
competition  law  approvals.  Our Company is  currently  working  with Nestle to
finalize the legal  documentation  necessary to effectuate the transaction,  and
expects this to be completed in the near future.

OTHER DEVELOPMENTS
------------------
     In  February  2001,  our  Company  reached  agreement  with  Carlsberg  A/S
("Carlsberg")  for the dissolution of Coca-Cola  Nordic  Beverages  ("CCNB"),  a
joint  venture  bottler  which was  51%-owned by Carlsberg  and 49%-owned by the
Company. At that time, CCNB had bottling operations in Sweden, Norway,  Denmark,
Finland and Iceland.  Pursuant to the agreement,  CCNB sold its Iceland bottling
operation  to a  third-party  group of  investors  in May 2001.  Also  under the
agreement with Carlsberg, our Company acquired CCNB's Sweden and Norway bottling
operations in June 2001, increasing the Company's ownership in those bottlers to
100%. At that same time,  Carlsberg acquired CCNB's Denmark and Finland bottling
operations,  increasing  Carlsberg's  ownership in those bottlers to 100%. It is
planned for the CCNB holding company to be liquidated during 2002.

     In July 2001,  our  Company  and San Miguel  Corporation  ("SMC")  acquired
Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines,  Inc. ("CCBPI") from Coca-Cola Amatil. Coca-Cola
Amatil bought back and cancelled approximately 153.9 million shares of its stock
from our Company,  and 219.4 million shares of its stock from SMC, all at A$5.16
per share, in exchange for Coca-Cola  Amatil's  transfer of 1.236 million shares
of CCBPI to our  Company  and SMC.  Upon  completion  of this  transaction,  our
Company owned 35% of the common  shares and 100% of the Preferred B shares,  and
SMC  owned 65% of the  common  shares of CCBPI.  CCBPI  retained  liability  for
approximately A$135.2 million in net debt. Also, prior to the transaction, CCBPI
bought back and  cancelled  certain  shares of its common  stock from  Coca-Cola
Amatil in exchange for a cash payment of A$351.2 million to Coca-Cola Amatil. As
a result of the  transaction,  our Company's  interest in the reduced  equity of
Coca-Cola Amatil was reduced from approximately 38% to approximately 35%.

     In November  2001,  our Company  sold  substantially  all of its  ownership
interests  in various  Russian  bottling  operations  to  Coca-Cola  HBC.  These
consisted  of the  Company's  40%  ownership  interest in a joint  venture  with
Coca-Cola  HBC that  operates  bottling  territories  in Siberia  and in part of
Western  Russia,  together  with  the  Company's  substantially   100%-ownership
interests in bottling  operations  with  territories  covering the  remainder of
Russia.

     In December 2001,  the Company  successfully  completed its  acquisition of
Odwalla,  Inc.  Featuring the Odwalla and Samantha lines of all-natural  juices,
smoothies,  dairy-free  shakes,  pure spring  water and natural  food bars,  the
California-based  company is the leading branded super-premium  beverage company
in the United States.

     The Company has concluded negotiations regarding the terms of a Control and
Profit and Loss ("CPL")  agreement  with certain other share owners of Coca-Cola
Erfrischungsgetraenke AG ("CCEAG"), the largest bottler in Germany, in which the
Company owns approximately a 41% ownership interest. Under the terms of the CPL

                                       8
<PAGE>

agreement,  in early 2002 the Company obtained management control of CCEAG for a
period of up to five years. This transaction will be accounted for as a business
combination.  In  return  for the  management  control  of  CCEAG,  the  Company
guaranteed  annual  payments  in lieu of  dividends  by CCEAG to all other CCEAG
share owners. Additionally,  all CCEAG share owners entered into either a put or
a put/call option agreement with the Company, exercisable at the end of the term
of the CPL agreement at agreed prices.

     In  January  2002,  our  Company  and  CCBPI  acquired  from RFM  Corp.,  a
Philippine  food and beverage  concern,  RFM's 83% ownership  interest in Cosmos
Bottling Corporation ("Cosmos"),  a publicly traded Philippine beverage company.
Our  Company  acquired  direct  and  indirect  ownership   interests  in  Cosmos
effectively totaling  approximately 62%. A subsequent tender offer has been made
by CCBPI and our Company to the remaining  minority share owners and is expected
to close in March 2002.

SEASONALITY
-----------
     Sales of ready-to-drink  nonalcoholic beverages are somewhat seasonal, with
the second and third calendar quarters  accounting for the highest sales volumes
in the Northern Hemisphere. The volume of sales in the beverages business may be
affected by weather conditions.

COMPETITION
-----------
     Our  Company  competes  in  the  nonalcoholic   beverages  segment  of  the
commercial beverages industry. That segment is highly competitive, consisting of
numerous firms. These include firms that compete,  like the Company, in multiple
geographical  areas as well as  firms  that are  primarily  local in  operation.
Competitive  products include  carbonates,  packaged water,  juices and nectars,
fruit drinks and dilutables  (including syrups and powdered drinks),  sports and
energy drinks,  coffee and tea, still drinks and other  beverages.  Nonalcoholic
beverages are sold to consumers in both  ready-to-drink  and  not-ready-to-drink
form.

     Most of our Company's  beverages  business  currently is in soft drinks, as
that term is defined in this report. The soft-drink  business,  which is part of
the nonalcoholic beverages segment, is itself highly competitive. Our Company is
the leading seller of soft-drink  concentrates and syrups in the world. Numerous
firms,  however,  compete in that  business.  These consist of a range of firms,
from local to  international,  that  compete  against  the  Company in  numerous
geographical areas.

     Competitive factors with respect to the Company's business include pricing,
advertising  and  sales  promotion  programs,   product  innovation,   increased
efficiency in production  techniques,  the  introduction  of new packaging,  new
vending  and  dispensing  equipment  and brand  and  trademark  development  and
protection.

RAW MATERIALS
-------------
     The principal  raw material  used by our  Company's  business in the United
States is  high-fructose  corn syrup,  a form of sugar,  which is available from
numerous  domestic  sources and is  historically  subject to fluctuations in its
market price. The principal raw material used by the Company's  business outside
the  United  States  is  sucrose.  Our  Company  has  a  specialized   sweetener
procurement  staff and has not  experienced  any  difficulties  in obtaining its
requirements.  In the United States and certain other countries, the Company has
authorized the use of high-fructose  corn syrup in syrup for Coca-Cola and other
Company  Trademark  Beverages  for  use in  both  fountain  syrup  and  finished
beverages in bottles and cans.

     Generally,  raw  materials  utilized  by our  Company in its  business  are
readily available from numerous sources.  However,  aspartame,  which is usually
used alone or in combination  with either  saccharin or acesulfame  potassium in
the Company's  low-calorie  soft-drink  products,  is currently purchased by the
Company  primarily  from The  NutraSweet  Company  and from  Holland  Sweetener.
Acesulfame potassium is currently purchased from Nutrinova Nutrition Specialties
& Food Ingredients GmbH.

     With  regard to juice and  juice-drink  products,  the citrus  industry  is
subject to the variability of weather conditions,  in particular the possibility
of freezes in central Florida, which may result in higher prices and lower

                                       9

<PAGE>

consumer demand for orange juice  throughout the industry.  Due to our Company's
long-standing  relationship  with a supplier of  high-quality  Brazilian  orange
juice  concentrate,  the  supply of juice  available  that  meets the  Company's
standards is normally adequate to meet demand.

PATENTS, TRADE SECRETS, TRADEMARKS AND COPYRIGHTS
-------------------------------------------------
     Our Company is the owner of numerous patents, copyrights and trade secrets,
as well as substantial know-how and technology (herein collectively  referred to
as  "technology"),  relating  to  its  products  and  the  processes  for  their
production,  the packages  used for its  products,  the design and  operation of
various  processes  and  equipment  used in its  business  and  certain  quality
assurance  and  financial  software.  Some  of the  technology  is  licensed  to
suppliers  and other  parties.  The  Company's  soft  drink  and other  beverage
formulae are among the important trade secrets of the Company.

     Our  Company  owns  numerous  trademarks  which are very  important  to its
business. Depending upon the jurisdiction,  trademarks are valid as long as they
are in use and/or their  registrations are properly maintained and they have not
been found to have become generic.  Registrations of trademarks can generally be
renewed  indefinitely  as long as the trademarks are in use. The majority of our
Company's  trademark license agreements are included in the Company's  Bottler's
Agreements.  The  Company  has  registered  and  licenses  the  right to use its
trademarks  in  conjunction  with certain  merchandise  other than  nonalcoholic
beverages.

GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION
-----------------------
     The production,  distribution  and sale in the United States of many of the
Company's  products are subject to the Federal Food,  Drug and Cosmetic Act; the
Occupational  Safety  and Health  Act;  the Lanham  Act;  various  environmental
statutes;  and various other federal,  state and local statutes and  regulations
applicable  to  the  production,   transportation,  sale,  safety,  advertising,
labeling and ingredients of such products.

     A California  law requires  that a specific  warning  appear on any product
that  contains  a  component  listed by the State as having  been found to cause
cancer or birth defects.  The law exposes all food and beverage producers to the
possibility  of having to provide  warnings  on their  products  because the law
recognizes no generally applicable quantitative thresholds below which a warning
is not  required.  Consequently,  even trace  amounts of listed  components  can
expose affected products to the prospect of warning labels.  Products containing
listed substances that occur naturally in the product or that are contributed to
the product  solely by a municipal  water supply are  generally  exempt from the
warning  requirement.  While no Company beverage products are currently required
to display  warnings under this law, our Company is unable to predict whether an
important  component of a Company  product might be added to the California list
in the future. Our Company is also unable to predict whether or to what extent a
warning  under  this law  would  have an  impact  on  costs or sales of  Company
beverage products.

     Bottlers of the Company's beverage products presently offer non-refillable,
recyclable  containers  in all areas of the United  States and  Canada.  Some of
these  bottlers also offer  refillable  containers,  which are also  recyclable.
Measures have been enacted in various localities and states which require that a
deposit be charged for certain non- refillable beverage containers.  The precise
requirements imposed by these measures vary. Other deposit, recycling or product
stewardship  proposals have been  introduced in states and localities and in the
Congress,  and the Company  anticipates that similar  legislation or regulations
may be proposed in the future at the local,  state and federal  levels,  both in
the United States and elsewhere.

     All of our  Company's  facilities  in the  United  States  are  subject  to
federal,  state and local  environmental  laws and regulations.  Compliance with
these provisions has not had, and the Company does not expect such compliance to
have, any material adverse effect upon our Company's capital  expenditures,  net
income or competitive position.

EMPLOYEES
---------
     As of December 31, 2001, our Company employed approximately 38,000 persons,
compared  to  approximately  36,900  at the end of  2000.  At the  end of  2001,
approximately 9,800 Company employees were located in the United States.

     Our  Company,  through its  divisions  and  subsidiaries,  has entered into
numerous  collective  bargaining  agreements,  and the  Company has no reason to
believe it will not be able to renegotiate  any such  agreements on satisfactory
terms.  The Company believes that its relations with its employees are generally
satisfactory.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
------------------

    Our Company's worldwide headquarters is located on a 35-acre office complex

headquarters  building,  the  approximately  870,000 square foot Coca-Cola North
America  building and the  approximately  264,000  square foot  Coca-Cola  Plaza
building. Also located in the complex are several other buildings, including the
technical  and  engineering  facilities,   learning  center  and  the  Company's
reception  center.  In the first  quarter of 2001,  the  Company  began  leasing
approximately  250,000  square  feet of  office  space at 10  Glenlake  Parkway,
Atlanta,  Georgia,  as the main  office  for the  Company's  Coca-Cola  Fountain
business unit, which is responsible for fountain sales in the United States.  In
addition,  the Company leases approximately  155,000 square feet of office space
at Northridge Business Park, Dunwoody, Georgia, for some of Coca-Cola Fountain's
operations.   The  Company  has   facilities  for   administrative   operations,
manufacturing,   processing,   packaging,   packing,   storage  and  warehousing
throughout the United States.

     Our Company  owns and  operates 32 principal  beverage  concentrate  and/or
syrup  manufacturing  plants located throughout the world. The Company currently
owns or holds a majority  interest in 19 operations  with 72 principal  beverage
bottling and canning plants located outside the United States.  The Company also
owns a facility that manufactures juice concentrates for food service use.

     In addition,  The Minute Maid  Company,  a Company  division  with business
headquarters located in Houston, Texas, occupies its own office building,  which
contains  approximately  330,000 square feet.  The Minute Maid Company  operates
eight production facilities throughout the United States and Canada and utilizes
a system of contract packers to produce and distribute certain products in areas
where The Minute Maid  Company  does not have its own  manufacturing  centers or
during periods when it experiences shortfalls in manufacturing capacity.

     Our  Company  owns  or  leases   additional   real   estate,   including  a
Company-owned  office and retail  building at 711 Fifth Avenue in New York,  New
York and approximately 315,000 square feet of Company-owned office and technical
space in  Brussels,  Belgium.  Additional  owned or leased real  estate  located
throughout  the world is used by the  Company  as office  space,  for  bottling,
warehouse or retail operations or, in the case of some owned property, is leased
to others.

     Management  believes that the facilities for the production of its products
are suitable and adequate  for the  business  conducted  therein,  that they are
being  appropriately  utilized in line with past  experience  and that they have
sufficient  production capacity for their present intended purposes.  The extent
of  utilization  of such  facilities  varies based upon the seasonal  demand for
product.  While it is not  possible to measure  with any degree of  certainty or
uniformity  the   productive   capacity  and  extent  of  utilization  of  these
facilities,  management  believes that additional  production can be obtained at
the existing  facilities by the addition of personnel and capital equipment and,
in some  facilities,  the  addition of shifts of  personnel or expansion of such
facilities.  Our Company continuously  reviews its anticipated  requirements for
facilities  and,  on the basis of that  review,  may from  time to time  acquire
additional facilities and/or dispose of existing facilities.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
-------------------------

     On October 27, 2000, a class action  lawsuit was filed in the United States
District Court for the Northern  District of Georgia  alleging that the Company,
M.  Douglas  Ivester,  Jack L. Stahl and James E.  Chestnut  violated  antifraud
provisions  of the  federal  securities  laws by  making  misrepresentations  or
material omissions relating to the Company's  financial  condition and prospects
in late 1999 and early 2000 (the "Carpenters  Health & Welfare Fund Action").  A
second,  largely  identical  lawsuit  was filed in the same court on November 9,
2000 (the  "LaValla  Action").  The  Complaints  allege that the Company and the
individual  named  officers:  (1) forced certain  Coca-Cola  system  bottlers to
accept "excessive,  unwanted and unneeded" sales of concentrate during the third
and fourth quarters of 1999, thus creating a misleading  sense of improvement in
our Company's performance in those quarters;  (2) failed to write down the value
of impaired  assets in Russia,  Japan and  elsewhere  on a timely  basis,  again
resulting in the  presentation of misleading  interim  financial  results in the
third and fourth  quarters of 1999; and (3)  misrepresented  the reasons for Mr.
Ivester's  departure  from the  Company  and  then  misleadingly  reassured  the
financial  community  that  there  would be no  changes  in the  Company's  core
business strategy or financial  outlook following that departure.  Damages in an
unspecified amount are sought in both Complaints.

     On January 8, 2001,  an order was entered by Judge  Willis B. Hunt,  Jr. of
the  United  States  District  Court  for  the  Northern   District  of  Georgia
consolidating  the two cases for all  purposes.  Judge  Hunt  also  ordered  the
plaintiffs  to  file  a  Consolidated  Amended  Complaint.  On  July  25,  2001,
plaintiffs filed a Consolidated  Amended  Complaint,  which largely repeated the
allegations  made in the  original  Complaints  and added  Douglas N. Daft as an
additional defendant.

     On September 25, 2001,  the Company filed a Motion to Dismiss all counts of
the  Consolidated  Amended  Complaint.  Plaintiffs  filed their  response to the
Motion to Dismiss on December 10, 2001, and the Company filed its reply brief on
January 18, 2002. A decision on the Motion to Dismiss is expected in 2002.

     The Company  believes it has  meritorious  legal and factual  defenses  and
intends to defend the consolidated action vigorously.

     The Company is involved in various other legal  proceedings.  Management of
the Company  believes  that any  liability  to the Company  which may arise as a
result of these proceedings,  including the proceedings  specifically  discussed
above, will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the
Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole.
