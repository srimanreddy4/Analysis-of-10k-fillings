NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Note 1 &#150; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Apple Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively &#147;Apple&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;) design, manufacture, and market personal computers, mobile communication devices, and portable digital music and video players and sell a variety of related software, third-party digital content and applications, services, peripherals, and networking solutions. The Company sells its products worldwide through its online stores, its retail stores, its direct sales force, and third-party wholesalers, resellers and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party Macintosh (&#147;Mac&#148;), iPhone and iPod compatible products including application software, printers, storage devices, speakers, headphones, and various other accessories and supplies through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to consumer, small and mid-sized business (&#147;SMB&#148;), education, enterprise, government and creative customers. 

Basis of Presentation and Preparation 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#147;GAAP&#148;) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. 

Certain prior year amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current year&#146;s presentation. During the first quarter of 2009, the Company reclassified $2.4 billion of certain fixed-income securities from short-term marketable securities to long-term marketable securities in the September 27, 2008 Consolidated Balance Sheet. The reclassification resulted from a change in accounting presentation for certain investments based on contractual maturity dates, which more closely reflects the Company&#146;s assessment of the timing of when such securities will be converted to cash. As a result of this change, marketable securities with maturities less than 12 months are classified as short-term and marketable securities with maturities greater than 12 months are classified as long-term. There have been no changes in the Company&#146;s investment policies or practices associated with this change in accounting presentation. See Note 2, &#147;Financial Instruments&#148; of this Form 10-K for additional information. 

The Company&#146;s fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The Company&#146;s fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007 ended on September 26, 2009, September 27, 2008 and September 29, 2007, respectively, and included 52 weeks each. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter approximately every six years to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years or quarters refer to the Company&#146;s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters of those fiscal years. 

In May 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) established general accounting standards and disclosure for subsequent events. The Company adopted FASB Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;ASC&#148;) 855, Subsequent Events (formerly referenced as Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (&#147;SFAS&#148;) No. 165, Subsequent Events ), during the third quarter of 2009. The Company has evaluated subsequent events through the date and time the financial statements were issued on October 27, 2009. 

Financial Instruments 

Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities 

All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. The Company&#146;s debt and marketable equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments in debt securities at 

&#160; 

the time of purchase and reevaluates the available-for-sale designations as of each balance sheet date. The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument&#146;s underlying contractual maturity date. Marketable securities with maturities of less than 12 months are classified as short-term and marketable securities with maturities greater than 12 months are classified as long-term. These securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of shareholders&#146; equity. The cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method. 

Derivative Financial Instruments 

During the second quarter of 2009, the Company adopted FASB ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (formerly referenced as SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities &#150; an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 ), which requires additional disclosures about the Company&#146;s objectives and strategies for using derivative instruments, how the derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for, and how the derivative instruments and related hedged item affect the financial statements. 

The Company accounts for its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value. Derivatives that are not defined as hedges must be adjusted to fair value through earnings. 

For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders&#146; equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in current earnings. To receive hedge accounting treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability and that are designated as fair value hedges, the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the current period. The Company did not have a net gain or loss on these derivative instruments during 2009, 2008 and 2007. The net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative instrument that is designated as an economic hedge of the foreign currency translation exposure of the net investment in a foreign operation is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. For forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or losses related to this component are recognized in current earnings. 

Fair Value Measurements 

During the first quarter of 2009, the Company adopted FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (formerly referenced as SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements ), which defines fair value, establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements. This new accounting standard does not require any new fair value measurements. The Company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and credit risk. 

During the first quarter of 2009, the Company adopted FASB ASC 825, Financial Instruments (formerly referenced as SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities &#150; Including 

&#160; 

an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 ) , which allows companies to choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not required to be measured at fair value. The Company has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments. 

Inventories 

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, computed using the first-in, first-out method, or market. If the cost of the inventories exceeds their market value, provisions are made currently for the difference between the cost and the market value. The Company&#146;s inventories consist primarily of finished goods for all periods presented. 

Property, Plant and Equipment 

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by use of the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, up to five years for equipment, and the shorter of lease terms or ten years for leasehold improvements. The Company capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years. Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $577 million, $363 million and $249 million during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 

Asset Retirement Obligations 

The Company records obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. The Company reviews legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the assets. If it is determined that a legal obligation exists, the fair value of the liability for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. The difference between the gross expected future cash flow and its present value is accreted over the life of the related lease as an operating expense. All of the Company&#146;s existing asset retirement obligations are associated with commitments to return property subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination. The Company&#146;s asset retirement liability was $25 million and $21 million as of September 26, 2009 and September 27, 2008, respectively. 

Long-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets 

The Company reviews property, plant and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If property, plant and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. The Company did not record any material impairments during 2009, 2008 and 2007. 

The Company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, rather such assets are required to be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. The Company performs its goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests on or about August 31 of each year. The Company did not recognize any goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in 2009, 2008 and 2007. The Company established reporting units based on its current reporting structure. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit. 

&#160; 

The Company amortizes its intangible assets with definite lives over their estimated useful lives and reviews these assets for impairment. The Company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods ranging from one to ten years. 

Foreign Currency Translation and Remeasurement 

The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are credited or charged to foreign currency translation included in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders&#146; equity. The Company&#146;s subsidiaries that use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, and inventories, property, and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates. Gains and losses from these remeasurements were insignificant and have been included in the Company&#146;s results of operations. 

Revenue Recognition 

Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, peripherals, and service and support contracts. For any product within these groups that either is software, or is considered software-related (e.g., Mac computers, iPhones and iPod portable digital music and video players), the Company accounts for such products in accordance with the specific industry accounting guidance for software and software related transactions. The Company applies various revenue-related GAAP for products that are not software or software-related, such as digital content sold on the iTunes Store and certain Mac, iPhone and iPod supplies and accessories, which is described below. 

The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Company&#146;s product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company legally retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. If at the outset of an arrangement the Company determines the arrangement fee is not, or is presumed not to be, fixed or determinable, revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable and all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met. 

Revenue from service and support contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the service coverage periods. These contracts typically include extended phone support, repair services, web-based support resources, diagnostic tools, and extend the service coverage offered under the Company&#146;s standard limited warranty. 

The Company sells software and peripheral products obtained from other companies. The Company generally establishes its own pricing and retains related inventory risk, is the primary obligor in sales transactions with its customers, and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers. Accordingly, the Company generally recognizes revenue for the sale of products obtained from other companies based on the gross amount billed. 

The Company accounts for multiple element arrangements that consist only of software or software-related products in accordance with industry specific accounting guidance for software and software related transactions. If a multiple-element arrangement includes deliverables that are neither software nor software-related, the Company applies various revenue-related GAAP to determine if those deliverables constitute separate units of accounting from the software or software-related deliverables. If the Company can separate the deliverables, the Company applies the industry specific accounting guidance to the software and software-related deliverables and applies other appropriate guidance to the non-software related deliverables. Revenue on arrangements that include multiple elements such as hardware, software and services is allocated to each element based on the 

&#160; 

relative fair value of each element. Each element&#146;s allocated revenue is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for that element have been met. Fair value is generally determined by vendor specific objective evidence (&#147;VSOE&#148;), which is based on the price charged when each element is sold separately. If the Company cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in a multiple-element arrangement, the Company defers revenue until all elements are delivered and services have been performed, or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements. When the fair value of a delivered element has not been established, but fair value exists for the undelivered elements, the Company uses the residual method to recognize revenue if the fair value of all undelivered elements is determinable. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue. 

For both iPhone and Apple TV, the Company has indicated it may from time-to-time provide future unspecified features and additional software products free of charge to customers. Accordingly, iPhone handsets and Apple TV sales are accounted for under subscription accounting in accordance with GAAP. As such, the revenue and associated cost of sales are deferred at the time of sale, and are both recognized on a straight-line basis over the currently estimated 24-month economic life of these products, with any loss recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred by the Company for engineering, sales, marketing and warranty are expensed as incurred. 

The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. The estimated cost of these programs is accrued as a reduction to revenue in the period the Company has sold the product and committed to a plan. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company&#146;s historical experience. Revenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority. 

Generally, the Company does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in connection with software sales or the sale of extended warranty and support contracts. When the Company does offer specified upgrade rights, the Company defers revenue for the fair value of the specified upgrade right until the future obligation is fulfilled or the right to the specified upgrade expires. A limited number of the Company&#146;s software products are available with maintenance agreements that grant customers rights to unspecified future upgrades over the maintenance term on a when and if available basis. Revenue associated with such maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term. 

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 

The Company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors. The Company considers historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of the Company&#146;s customers, current economic conditions, and other factors that may affect customers&#146; ability to pay. 

Shipping Costs 

For all periods presented, amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as revenue, and the Company&#146;s shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales. 

Warranty Expense 

The Company generally provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. The Company assesses the adequacy of its preexisting warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates. For products accounted for under subscription accounting, the Company recognizes warranty expense as incurred. 

&#160; 

Software Development Costs 

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a product&#146;s technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers. In most instances, the Company&#146;s products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established. Therefore, costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally most software development costs have been expensed. 

In 2009 and 2008, the Company capitalized $71 million and $11 million, respectively, of costs associated with the development of Mac OS X Version 10.6 Snow Leopard (&#147;Mac OS X Snow Leopard&#148;), which was released during the fourth quarter of 2009. During 2007, the Company capitalized $75 million of costs associated with the development of Mac OS X Version 10.5 Leopard (&#147;Mac OS X Leopard&#148;) and iPhone software. The capitalized costs are being amortized to cost of sales on a straight-line basis over a three year estimated useful life of the underlying technology. 

Total amortization related to capitalized software development costs was $25 million, $27 million and $13 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 

Advertising Costs 

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $501 million, $486 million and $467 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 

Stock-Based Compensation 

The Company accounts for stock-based payment transactions in which the Company receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the enterprise or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise&#146;s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. Stock-based compensation cost for restricted stock units (&#147;RSUs&#148;) is measured based on the closing fair market value of the Company&#146;s common stock on the date of grant. Stock-based compensation cost for stock options is estimated at the grant date based on each option&#146;s fair-value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton (&#147;BSM&#148;) option-pricing model. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation cost as expense ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company will recognize a benefit from stock-based compensation in equity if an incremental tax benefit is realized by following the ordering provisions of the tax law. In addition, the Company accounts for the indirect effects of stock-based compensation on the research tax credit, the foreign tax credit and the domestic manufacturing deduction through the income statement. Further information regarding stock-based compensation can be found in Note 7, &#147;Shareholders&#146; Equity and Stock-Based Compensation.&#148; 

Income Taxes 

The provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. 

During 2008, the Company adopted FASB Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;ASC&#148;) 740, Income Taxes (formerly referenced as FASB Financial Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes &#150; an 

&#160; 

interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109) , which changed the framework for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. See Note 6, &#147;Income Taxes&#148; for additional information, including the effects of adoption on the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements. 

Earnings Per Common Share 

Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued. Potentially dilutive securities include outstanding stock options, shares to be purchased under the employee stock purchase plan and unvested RSUs. The dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities is reflected in diluted earnings per common share by application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market value of the Company&#146;s common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities. 

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share for the three years ended September 26, 2009 (in thousands, except net income in millions and per share amounts):

Comprehensive Income 

Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under GAAP are recorded as an element of shareholders&#146; equity but are excluded from net income. The Company&#146;s other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges. 

Segment Information 

The Company reports segment information based on the &#147;management&#148; approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company&#146;s reportable segments. Information about the Company&#146;s products, major customers and geographic areas on a company-wide basis is also disclosed.

&#160; $ 33,992 &#160; $ 24,490 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END During the first quarter of 2009, the Company changed its accounting presentation for certain fixed-income investments, which resulted in the reclassification of certain investments from short-term marketable securities to long-term marketable securities. As a result, prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current year&#146;s presentation. The Company classifies its marketable securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument&#146;s underlying contractual maturity date, while its prior classifications were based on the nature of the securities and their availability for use in current operations. As a result of this change, marketable securities with maturities of less than 12 months are classified as short-term and marketable securities with maturities greater than 12 months are classified as long-term. The Company&#146;s long-term marketable securities&#146; maturities range from one year to five years. The Company believes this new presentation is preferable as it more closely reflects the Company&#146;s assessment of the timing of when such securities will be converted to cash. Accordingly, certain fixed-income investments totaling $2.4 billion have been reclassified from short-term marketable securities to long-term marketable securities in the September 27, 2008 Consolidated Balance Sheet to conform to the current year&#146;s financial statement presentation. There have been no changes in the Company&#146;s investment policies or practices associated with this change in accounting presentation.

The net unrealized gains as of September 26, 2009 and the net unrealized losses as of September 27, 2008 related primarily to long-term marketable securities. The Company may sell certain of its marketable securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes, in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for duration management. The Company recognized no material net gains or losses during 2009, 2008 and 2007 related to such sales.

The Company considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities investment portfolio to be temporary in nature. The unrealized losses on the Company&#146;s marketable securities were caused primarily by changes in market interest rates, specifically, widening credit spreads. The Company typically invests in highly-rated securities, and its policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company&#146;s investment policy requires investments to be investment grade, primarily rated single-A or better, with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating the investments for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, and the Company&#146;s intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell, the investment before recovery of the investment&#146;s amortized cost basis. During the years ended September 26, 2009 and September 27, 2008, the Company did not recognize any material impairment charges. As of September 26, 2009, the Company does not consider any of its investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired. 

Derivative Financial Instruments 

The Company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset some of the foreign exchange risk of expected future cash flows on certain forecasted revenue and cost of sales, of net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and on certain existing assets and liabilities. To help protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company&#146;s subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar, hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue. The Company&#146;s subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar and who sell in local currencies, may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries&#146; functional currencies. The Company typically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases for three to six months. To help protect the net investment in a foreign operation from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company may also enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign currency exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to immateriality, accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange rates. 

The Company&#146;s accounting policies for these instruments are based on whether the instruments are designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. The Company records all derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The effective portions of net investment hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment. Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments and the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges and net investment hedges are adjusted to fair value through earnings in other income and expense. 

The Company had a net deferred gain associated with cash flow hedges of approximately $31 million and $19 million, net of taxes, recorded in other comprehensive income as of September 26, 2009 and September 27, 2008, respectively. Other comprehensive income associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue is recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and other comprehensive income related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases is recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. The portion of the Company&#146;s net deferred gain related to products under subscription accounting is expected to be recorded in earnings ratably over the related products&#146; estimated economic lives beginning when the hedged transactions occur, while the portion of the net deferred gain related to other products is expected to be recorded in earnings at the time the hedged transactions occur. As of September 26, 2009, the hedged transactions are expected to occur within six months. 

&#160; 

Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two month time period. Deferred gains and losses in other comprehensive income associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified immediately into earnings through other income and expense. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments also are reflected in current earnings unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. The Company did not recognize any material net gains or losses related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges during 2009, 2008 and 2007. 

The Company had an unrealized net loss on net investment hedges of $2 million and $1 million, net of taxes, included in the cumulative translation adjustment account of accumulated other comprehensive income (&#147;AOCI&#148;) as of September 26, 2009 and September 27, 2008, respectively. The ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness test of net investment hedges are recorded in current earnings in other income and expense. 

The Company recognized in earnings a net gain of $133 million on foreign currency forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments during the year ended September 26, 2009. 

The following table shows the notional principal and credit risk amounts of the Company&#146;s derivative instruments outstanding as of September 26, 2009 and September 27, 2008 (in millions):

&#160; $ 3,416 &#160; $ 10 &#160; $ 2,868 &#160; $ 8 ##TABLE_END The notional principal amounts for derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding as of September 26, 2009, and do not represent the amount of the Company&#146;s exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amounts represent the Company&#146;s gross exposure to potential accounting loss on these transactions if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency exchange rates at each respective date. The Company&#146;s gross exposure on these transactions may be further mitigated by collateral received from certain counterparties. The Company&#146;s exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as a function of currency exchange rates. Although the table above reflects the notional principal and credit risk amounts of the Company&#146;s foreign exchange instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the foreign exchange instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. 

The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received when the net fair value of certain financial instruments exceeds contractually established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values. The Company did not record a material amount of cash collateral related to the derivative instruments under its master netting arrangements as of September 26, 2009. The Company did not have any derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features that would require it to post additional collateral as of September 26, 2009. 

The estimates of fair value are based on applicable and commonly used pricing models and prevailing financial market information as of September 26, 2009. Refer to Note 3, &#147;Fair Value Measurements&#148; of this Form 10-K,

Accounts Receivable 

Trade Receivables 

The Company distributes its products through third-party distributors, cellular network carriers, and resellers and directly to certain education, consumer and enterprise customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Australia, or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. However, considerable trade receivables not covered by collateral, third-party financing arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the Company&#146;s distribution and retail channel partners. Trade receivables from one of the Company&#146;s customers accounted for 16% of trade receivables as of September 26, 2009 and two of the Company&#146;s customers accounted for 15% and 10%, respectively, of trade receivables as of September 27, 2008. 

The following table summarizes the activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts for the three years ended September 26, 2009 (in millions):

The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these raw material components directly from suppliers. These non-trade receivables, which are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in other current assets, totaled $1.7 billion and $2.3 billion as of September 26, 2009 and September 27, 2008, respectively. Vendor non-trade receivables from two of the Company&#146;s vendors accounted for 40% and 36%, respectively, of non-trade receivables as of September 26, 2009 and two of the Company&#146;s vendors accounted for 47% and 38%, respectively, of non-trade receivables as of September 27, 2008. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in net sales and does not recognize any profits on these sales until the related products are sold by the Company, at which time any profit is recognized as a reduction of cost of sales. 

Note 3 &#150; Fair Value Measurements 

The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and credit risk. 

&#160; 

The Company applies the following fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement: 

Level 1 &#150; Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2 &#150; Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 

Level 3 &#150; Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management&#146;s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. 

The Company&#146;s valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities were derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of all other financial instruments, all of which have counterparties with high credit ratings, were valued based on quoted market prices or model driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.

&#160; 

The Company&#146;s goodwill is allocated primarily to the America&#146;s reportable operating segment. Amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets was $53 million, $46 million and $35 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. As of September 26, 2009 and September 27, 2008, the remaining weighted-average amortization period for acquired technology was 7.2 years and 7.0 years, respectively.

As of September 26, 2009 and September 27, 2008, $17.4 billion and $11.3 billion, respectively, of the Company&#146;s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. The Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements provide for any related tax liability on amounts that may be repatriated, aside from undistributed earnings of certain of the Company&#146;s foreign subsidiaries that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the U.S. U.S. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $5.1 billion of such earnings. It is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that might be incurred if these earnings were to be distributed. 

&#160; 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax losses, credits, and the future income tax effects of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.

&#160; &#160; 29% &#160; &#160; &#160; 30% &#160; &#160; &#160; 30% &#160; ##TABLE_END The Company&#146;s income taxes payable have been reduced by the tax benefits from employee stock plan awards. For stock options, the Company receives an income tax benefit calculated as the difference between the fair market value of the stock issued at the time of the exercise and the option price, tax effected. The Company had net tax benefits from employee stock plan awards of $246 million, $770 million and $398 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, which were reflected as increases to common stock. 

On October 3, 2008, the Tax Extenders and Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2008 was signed into law. This bill, among other things, retroactively extended the expired research and development tax credit. As a result, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $42 million in the first quarter of 2009 to account for the retroactive effects of the research credit extension. 

Uncertain Tax Positions 

As discussed in Note 1, &#147;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#148; the Company adopted new accounting principles on accounting for uncertain tax positions in 2008. Under these new principles, tax positions are evaluated in a two-step process. The Company first determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax 

&#160; 

position will be sustained upon examination. If a tax position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold it is then measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Upon adoption of these new principles, the Company&#146;s cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulted in an increase to retained earnings of $11 million. The Company had historically classified interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits as current liabilities. Beginning with the adoption of these new principles, the Company classifies gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year as non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of the date of adoption was $475 million, of which $209 million, if recognized, would affect the Company&#146;s effective tax rate. 

The Company&#146;s total gross unrecognized tax benefits are classified as non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 26, 2009, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $971 million, of which $307 million, if recognized, would affect the Company&#146;s effective tax rate. As of September 27, 2008, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $506 million, of which $253 million, if recognized, would affect the Company&#146;s effective tax rate. 

On May 27, 2009, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued its ruling in the case of Xilinx, Inc. v. Commissioner , holding that stock-based compensation is required to be included in certain transfer pricing arrangements between a U.S. company and its offshore subsidiary. As a result of the ruling in this case, the Company increased its liability for unrecognized tax benefits by approximately $86 million and decreased shareholders&#146; equity by approximately $78 million in the year ended September 26, 2009. 

The aggregate changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, for the two years ended September 26, 2009, is as follows (in millions):

&#160; $ 971 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END The Company&#146;s policy to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes did not change as a result of adopting the new accounting principles on accounting for uncertain tax positions in 2008. As of the date of adoption, the Company had accrued $203 million for the gross interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits. As of September 26, 2009 and September 27, 2008, the total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $291 million and $219 million, respectively, which is classified as non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In 2009 and 2008, the Company recognized interest expense in connection with tax matters of $64 million and $16 million, respectively. 

The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, all years prior to 2002 are closed. The years 2002-2003 have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service (the &#147;IRS&#148;) and disputed issues have been taken 

&#160; 

to administrative appeals. The IRS is currently examining the 2004-2006 years. In addition, the Company is also subject to audits by state, local and foreign tax authorities. In major states and major foreign jurisdictions, the years subsequent to 1988 and 2000, respectively, generally remain open and could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities. 

Management believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company&#146;s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management&#146;s expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs. Although timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could reduce its unrecognized tax benefits by between $105 million and $145 million in the next 12 months. 

Note 7 &#150; Shareholders&#146; Equity and Stock-Based Compensation 

Preferred Stock 

The Company has five million shares of authorized preferred stock, none of which is issued or outstanding. Under the terms of the Company&#146;s Restated Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Directors is authorized to determine or alter the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the Company&#146;s authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock. 

Comprehensive Income 

Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under GAAP are recorded as an element of shareholders&#146; equity but are excluded from net income. The Company&#146;s other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges. 

The following table summarizes the components of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of taxes, as of the three years ended September 26, 2009 (in millions):

Employee Benefit Plans 

2003 Employee Stock Plan 

The 2003 Employee Stock Plan (the &#147;2003 Plan&#148;) is a shareholder approved plan that provides for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers. The 2003 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, RSUs, stock appreciation rights, stock purchase rights and performance-based awards. Based on the terms of individual option grants, options granted under the 2003 Plan generally expire seven to ten years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of four years, based on continued employment, with either annual, semi-annual or quarterly vesting. In general, RSUs granted under the 2003 Plan vest over two to four years, are subject to the employees&#146; continued employment and do not have an expiration date. As of September 26, 2009, approximately 37 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the 2003 Plan. 

1997 Employee Stock Option Plan 

In August 1997, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors approved the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (the &#147;1997 Plan&#148;), a non-shareholder approved plan for grants of stock options to employees who are not officers of the Company. Based on the terms of individual option grants, options granted under the 1997 Plan generally expire seven to ten years after the grant date. All stock options granted under the 1997 Plan are fully vested. In October 2003, the Company terminated the 1997 Plan, and no new options can be granted from this plan. 

1997 Director Stock Option Plan 

In August 1997, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors adopted a Director Stock Option Plan (the &#147;Director Plan&#148;) for non-employee directors of the Company, which was approved by shareholders in 1998. Pursuant to the Director Plan, the Company&#146;s non-employee directors are granted an option to acquire 30,000 shares of common stock upon their initial election to the Board (&#147;Initial Options&#148;). The Initial Options vest and become exercisable in three equal annual installments on each of the first through third anniversaries of the grant date. On the fourth anniversary of a non-employee director&#146;s initial election to the Board and on each subsequent anniversary thereafter, the director will be entitled to receive an option to acquire 10,000 shares of common stock (&#147;Annual Options&#148;). Annual Options are fully vested and immediately exercisable on their date of grant. Options granted under the Director Plan expire ten years after the grant date. As of September 26, 2009, approximately 240,000 shares were reserved for future issuance under the Director Plan. 

Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans 

As of October 16, 2009, executive officers Timothy D. Cook, Ronald B. Johnson, Peter Oppenheimer, Philip W. Schiller and Bertrand Serlet have entered into trading plans pursuant to Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;). A trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Company&#146;s stock including the exercise and sale of employee stock options and shares acquired pursuant to the Company&#146;s employee stock purchase plan and upon vesting of RSUs. 

Employee Stock Purchase Plan 

The Company has a shareholder approved employee stock purchase plan (the &#147;Purchase Plan&#148;), under which substantially all employees may purchase common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values as of the beginning and end of six-month offering periods. Stock purchases 

&#160; 

under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of an employee&#146;s compensation, up to a maximum of $25,000 in any calendar year. The number of shares authorized to be purchased in any calendar year is limited to a total of 3 million shares. As of September 26, 2009, approximately 4.7 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan. 

Employee Savings Plan 

The Company has an employee savings plan (the &#147;Savings Plan&#148;) qualifying as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the Savings Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the IRS annual contribution limit ($16,500 for calendar year 2009). The Company matches 50% to 100% of each employee&#146;s contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the employee&#146;s eligible earnings. The Company&#146;s matching contributions to the Savings Plan were $59 million, $50 million and $39 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 

Restricted Stock Units 

Historically, the Company used equity awards in the form of stock options as one of the means for recruiting and retaining highly skilled talent. In conjunction with the Company&#146;s 2009 equity compensation program changes, it began issuing primarily RSUs rather than stock options for eligible employees as the primary type of long-term equity-based award. A summary of the Company&#146;s RSU activity and related information for the three years ended September 26, 2009, is as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):

Upon vesting, the RSUs are generally net share-settled to cover the required withholding tax and the remaining amount is converted into an equivalent number of shares of common stock. The majority of RSUs vested in 2009, 2008 and 2007, were net-share settled such that the Company withheld shares with value equivalent to the employees&#146; minimum statutory obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were approximately 707,000, 857,000 and 20,000 for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and were based on the value of the RSUs on their vesting date as determined by the Company&#146;s closing stock price. Total payments for the employees&#146; tax obligations to the taxing authorities were $82 million, $124 million and $3 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. These net-share settlements had the effect of share repurchases by the Company as they reduced and retired the number of shares that would have otherwise been issued as a result of the vesting and did not represent an expense to the Company.

The aggregate intrinsic value excludes the effect of stock options that have a zero or negative intrinsic value. Total intrinsic value of options at time of exercise was $827 million, $2.0 billion and $1.3 billion for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 

RSUs granted are deducted from the shares available for grant under the Company&#146;s stock option plans utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. Similarly, RSUs cancelled are added back to the shares available for grant under the Company&#146;s stock option plans utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs cancelled. Outstanding RSU balances are not included in the outstanding options balances in the stock option activity table. 

Stock-Based Compensation 

Stock-based compensation cost for RSUs is measured based on the closing fair market value of the Company&#146;s common stock on the date of grant. Stock-based compensation cost for stock options is estimated at the grant 

&#160; 

date based on each option&#146;s fair-value as calculated by the BSM option-pricing model. The BSM option-pricing model incorporates various assumptions including expected volatility, expected life and interest rates. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company&#146;s common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the Company&#146;s stock options and other relevant factors including implied volatility in market traded options on the Company&#146;s common stock. The Company bases its expected life assumption on its historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards it grants to employees. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation cost as expense ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. 

The weighted-average assumptions used for the three years ended September 26, 2009, and the resulting estimates of weighted-average fair value per share of options granted and of employee stock purchase plan rights (&#147;stock purchase rights&#148;) during those periods are as follows:

##TABLE_START (a) In conjunction with the Company&#146;s 2009 equity compensation program changes, it began issuing primarily RSUs rather than stock options to employees, although the Company continues to grant stock options to non-employee directors. Accordingly the weighted average expected life of stock options was influenced by non-employee director stock option grants, which had a ten-year expected life. The weighted average expected life of stock options also affects the resulting interest rate and expected volatility assumptions.

The income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation expense was $266 million, $169 million and $81 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options and RSUs expected to vest was $1.4 billion as of September 26, 2009, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.53 years. 

Note 8 &#150; Commitments and Contingencies 

Lease Commitments 

The Company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company does not currently utilize any other off-balance sheet financing arrangements. The 

&#160; 

major facility leases are generally for terms of one to 20 years and generally provide renewal options for terms of one to five additional years. Leases for retail space are for terms of five to 20 years, the majority of which are for ten years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of September 26, 2009, the Company&#146;s total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $1.9 billion, of which $1.5 billion related to leases for retail space. 

Rent expense under all operating leases, including both cancelable and noncancelable leases, was $231 million, $207 million and $151 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases having remaining terms in excess of one year as of September 26, 2009, are as follows (in millions):

The Company offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products. The basic warranty period for hardware products is typically one year from the date of purchase by the end-user. The Company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the Company&#146;s hardware products. The Company provides currently for the estimated cost that may be incurred under its basic limited product warranties at the time related revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals for product warranty obligations include the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection, historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Company&#146;s typical experience. The Company assesses the adequacy of its preexisting warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates. For products accounted for under subscription accounting, the Company recognizes warranty expense as incurred. 

The Company periodically provides updates to its applications and system software to maintain the software&#146;s compliance with published specifications. The estimated cost to develop such updates is accounted for as warranty costs that are recognized at the time related software revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals related to such updates include the number of units delivered, the number of updates expected to occur, and the historical cost and estimated future cost of the resources necessary to develop these updates. 

The following table reconciles changes in the Company&#146;s accrued warranties and related costs for the three years ended September 26, 2009 (in millions):

Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. 

&#160; 

However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a potential liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results. Therefore, the Company did not record a liability for infringement costs as of either September 26, 2009 or September 27, 2008. 

The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. However, the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations, and payments made under these agreements historically have not materially adversely affected the Company&#146;s financial condition or operating results. 

Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product 

Although most components essential to the Company&#146;s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components including but not limited to microprocessors, enclosures, certain liquid crystal displays (&#147;LCDs&#148;), certain optical drives and application-specific integrated circuits (&#147;ASICs&#148;) are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources, which subjects the Company to significant supply and pricing risks. Many of these and other key components that are available from multiple sources including but not limited to NAND flash memory, dynamic random access memory (&#147;DRAM&#148;) and certain LCDs, are subject at times to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. In addition, the Company has entered into certain agreements for the supply of key components including but not limited to microprocessors, NAND flash memory, DRAM and LCDs at favorable pricing, but there is no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar favorable terms, or at all, upon expiration or otherwise obtain favorable pricing in the future. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and/or price increases that can materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. 

The Company and other participants in the personal computer, mobile communication and consumer electronics industries also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. In addition, the Company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer, mobile communication and consumer electronics industries, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers&#146; yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the Company&#146;s supply of a key single-sourced component for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, if such components were available only at significantly higher prices, or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company&#146;s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Company&#146;s business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company&#146;s requirements. 

Significant portions of the Company&#146;s Mac computers, iPhones, iPods, logic boards and other assembled products are now manufactured by outsourcing partners, primarily in various parts of Asia. A significant concentration of this outsourced manufacturing is currently performed by only a few of the Company&#146;s outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these outsourcing partners are the sole-sourced supplier of components and manufacturing outsourcing for many of the Company&#146;s key products including but not limited to final assembly of substantially all of the Company&#146;s portable Mac computers, iPhones, iPods and most of the Company&#146;s desktop products. Although 

&#160; 

the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Company&#146;s operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. The Company&#146;s purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. 

Long-Term Supply Agreements 

The Company has entered into prepaid long-term supply agreements to secure the supply of certain inventory components. During the first quarter of 2009, a long-term supply agreement with Intel Corporation was terminated and the remaining prepaid balance of $167 million was repaid to the Company. During the second and fourth quarters of 2009, the Company made a prepayment of $500 million to LG Display for the purchase of LCD panels and a prepayment of $500 million to Toshiba to purchase NAND flash memory, respectively. As of September 26, 2009, the Company had a total of $1.2 billion of inventory component prepayments outstanding. 

Contingencies 

The Company is subject to certain other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not been fully adjudicated, which are discussed in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading &#147;Legal Proceedings.&#148; In the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results. However, the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. If the Company failed to prevail in any of these legal matters or if several of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. 

Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental, product safety and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including various countries within Europe and Asia and certain states and provinces within North America. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not materially adversely affect the Company&#146;s financial condition or operating results. 

Note 9 &#150; Segment Information and Geographic Data 

The Company reports segment information based on the &#147;management&#148; approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company&#146;s reportable segments. 

The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. Accordingly, the Company determined its operating segments, which are generally based on the nature and location of its customers, to be the Americas, Europe, Japan, Asia-Pacific, Retail and FileMaker operations. The Company&#146;s reportable operating segments consist of Americas, Europe, Japan and Retail operations. Other operating segments include Asia Pacific, which encompasses Australia and Asia except for Japan and the Company&#146;s FileMaker, Inc. subsidiary. The Americas, Europe, Japan and Asia Pacific segments exclude activities related to the Retail segment. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries, as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Retail segment operates Apple-owned retail stores in the U.S. and in international markets. Each reportable operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services to the same types of customers. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, &#147;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.&#148; 

The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers, while Retail segment net sales are based on sales from the Company&#146;s retail stores. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to 

&#160; 

third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the operating segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses, such as manufacturing costs and variances not included in standard costs, research and development, corporate marketing expenses, stock-based compensation expense, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges, and other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes. Segment assets exclude corporate assets, such as cash, short-term and long-term investments, manufacturing and corporate facilities, miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets. Except for the Retail segment, capital asset purchases for long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment. Cash payments for capital asset purchases by the Retail segment were $369 million, $389 million and $294 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 

The Company has certain retail stores that have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Company&#146;s more typical retail stores. The Company allocates certain operating expenses associated with its high-profile stores to corporate marketing expense to reflect the estimated Company-wide benefit. The allocation of these operating costs to corporate expense is based on the amount incurred for a high-profile store in excess of that incurred by a more typical Company retail location. The Company had opened a total of 11 high-profile stores as of September 26, 2009. Expenses allocated to corporate marketing resulting from the operations of high-profile stores were $65 million, $53 million and $39 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Apple Inc. 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Apple Inc. as of September 26, 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders&#146; equity, and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Apple Inc. at September 26, 2009, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Apple Inc.&#146;s internal control over financial reporting as of September 26, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#150; Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated October 27, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Ernst &#38; Young LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Apple Inc. 

We have audited Apple Inc.&#146;s internal control over financial reporting as of September 26, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#150; Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (&#147;the COSO criteria&#148;). Apple Inc.&#146;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management&#146;s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

In our opinion, Apple Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 26, 2009, based on the COSO criteria. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements of Apple Inc. as of and for the year ended September 26, 2009 and our report dated October 27, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
