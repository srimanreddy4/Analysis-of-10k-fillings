NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Note 1 &#150; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Apple Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively &#147;Apple&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;) designs, manufactures, and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, and portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and applications. The Company sells its products worldwide through its retail stores, online stores, and direct sales force, as well as through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party iPhone, iPad, Mac, and iPod compatible products including application software, and various accessories through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers. 

Basis of Presentation and Preparation 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#147;GAAP&#148;) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior year amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current year&#146;s presentation. Prior period costs associated with the Company&#146;s high-profile retail stores have been reclassified to conform to the current period&#146;s presentation. Refer to Note 8, &#147;Segment Information and Geographic Data&#148; of this Form 10-K. 

The Company&#146;s fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The Company&#146;s fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010 ended on September 29, 2012, September 24, 2011, and September 25, 2010, respectively. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter approximately every six years to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. Fiscal year 2012 spanned 53 weeks, with a 14th week included in the first quarter of 2012. Fiscal years 2011 and 2010 spanned 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years or quarters refer to the Company&#146;s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters of those fiscal years. 

Revenue Recognition 

Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, peripherals, and service and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Company&#146;s product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware, and third-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i) standalone sales of software products, (ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware. 

For the sale of most third-party products, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers because the Company establishes its own pricing for such products, retains related inventory risk for physical products, is the primary obligor to the customer and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its 

&#160; 

customers. For third-party applications sold through the App Store and Mac App Store and certain digital content sold through the iTunes Store, the Company does not determine the selling price of the products and is not the primary obligor to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in net sales only the commission it retains from each sale. The portion of the gross amount billed to customers that is remitted by the Company to third-party app developers and certain digital content owners is not reflected in the Company&#146;s Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

The Company records deferred revenue when it receives payments in advance of the delivery of products or the performance of services. This includes amounts that have been deferred for unspecified and specified software upgrade rights and non-software services that are attached to hardware and software products. The Company sells gift cards redeemable at its retail and online stores, and also sells gift cards redeemable on the iTunes Store for the purchase of digital content and software. The Company records deferred revenue upon the sale of the card, which is relieved upon redemption of the card by the customer. Revenue from AppleCare service and support contracts is deferred and recognized over the service coverage periods. AppleCare service and support contracts typically include extended phone support, repair services, web-based support resources and diagnostic tools offered under the Company&#146;s standard limited warranty. 

The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs. For transactions involving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded. For the Company&#146;s other customer incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company&#146;s historical experience. Revenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority. 

Revenue Recognition for Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables 

For multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product&#146;s functionality, undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware product&#146;s essential software, and undelivered non-software services, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the Company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (&#147;VSOE&#148;), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (&#147;TPE&#148;), and (iii) best estimate of selling price (&#147;ESP&#148;). VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable. ESPs reflect the Company&#146;s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. For multi-element arrangements accounted for in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on the VSOE of each element, and if VSOE does not exist revenue is recognized when elements lacking VSOE are delivered. 

For sales of qualifying versions of iPhone, iPad and iPod touch (&#147;iOS devices&#148;), Mac and Apple TV, the Company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features to the essential software bundled with each of these hardware products free of charge to customers. Essential software for iOS devices includes iOS and related applications and for Mac includes OS X, related applications and iLife. The Company also provides various non-software services to owners of qualifying versions of iOS devices and Mac. The Company has identified up to three deliverables regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of these devices. The first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale. The second deliverable is the embedded right included with the purchase of iOS devices, Mac and Apple TV to receive on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades and features relating to the product&#146;s essential software. The third deliverable is the non-software services to be provided to qualifying versions of iOS devices and Mac. The Company allocates revenue between 

&#160; 

these deliverables using the relative selling price method. Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for these deliverables, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company&#146;s ESPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software is recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. Revenue allocated to the embedded unspecified software upgrade rights and the non-software services is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided for each of these devices, which ranges from two to four years. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and related essential software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide non-software services are recognized as cost of sales as incurred, and engineering and sales and marketing costs are recognized as operating expenses as incurred. 

The Company&#146;s process for determining its ESP for deliverables without VSOE or TPE considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. The Company believes its customers would be reluctant to buy unspecified software upgrade rights for the essential software included with its qualifying hardware products. This view is primarily based on the fact that unspecified software upgrade rights do not obligate the Company to provide upgrades at a particular time or at all, and do not specify to customers which upgrades or features will be delivered. The Company also believes its customers would be unwilling to pay a significant amount for access to the non-software services because other companies offer similar services at little or no cost to users. Therefore, the Company has concluded that if it were to sell upgrade rights or access to the non-software services on a standalone basis, including those rights and services attached to iOS devices, Mac and Apple TV, the selling prices would be relatively low. Key factors considered by the Company in developing the ESPs for software upgrade rights include prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing of Apple-branded and third-party Mac and iOS compatible software, the nature of the upgrade rights (e.g., unspecified versus specified), and the relative ESP of the upgrade rights as compared to the total selling price of the product. The Company may also consider additional factors as appropriate, including the impact of other products and services provided to customers, the pricing of competitive alternatives if they exist, product-specific business objectives, and the length of time a particular version of a device has been available. When relevant, the same factors are considered by the Company in developing ESPs for offerings such as the non-software services; however, the primary consideration in developing ESPs for the non-software services is the estimated cost to provide such services, including consideration for a reasonable profit margin. 

For the three years ended September 29, 2012, the Company&#146;s combined ESPs for the unspecified software upgrade rights and the rights to receive the non-software services included with its qualifying hardware devices have ranged from $5 to $25. Revenue allocated to such rights included with iOS devices and Apple TV is recognized on a straight-line basis over two years, and revenue allocated to such rights included with Mac is recognized on a straight-line basis over four years. 

Shipping Costs 

For all periods presented, amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as revenue, and the Company&#146;s shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales. 

Warranty Expense 

The Company generally provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. The Company assesses the adequacy of its pre-existing warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates. 

Software Development Costs 

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a product&#146;s technological feasibility 

&#160; 

has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers. In most instances, the Company&#146;s products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established. Costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility were not significant, and generally software development costs were expensed as incurred during 2012, 2011 and 2010. 

Advertising Costs 

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $1.0 billion, $933 million and $691 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 

Share-based Compensation 

The Company recognizes expense related to share-based payment transactions in which it receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the Company or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise&#146;s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. Share-based compensation cost for restricted stock units (&#147;RSUs&#148;) is measured based on the closing fair market value of the Company&#146;s common stock on the date of grant. Share-based compensation cost for stock options is estimated at the grant date based on each option&#146;s fair-value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton (&#147;BSM&#148;) option-pricing model. The Company recognizes share-based compensation cost as expense ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company recognizes a benefit from share-based compensation in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders&#146; Equity if an incremental tax benefit is realized. In addition, the Company recognizes the indirect effects of share-based compensation on research and development tax credits, foreign tax credits and domestic manufacturing deductions in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in Note 6, &#147;Shareholders&#146; Equity and Share-based Compensation&#148; of this Form 10-K. 

Income Taxes 

The provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. 

The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. See Note 5, &#147;Income Taxes&#148; of this Form 10-K for additional information. 

Earnings Per Share 

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued. Potentially dilutive securities include outstanding stock options, shares to be purchased under the Company&#146;s employee stock purchase plan and unvested RSUs. The dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, an increase in 

&#160; 

the fair market value of the Company&#146;s common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities. 

The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2012, 2011, and 2010 (in thousands, except net income in millions and per share amounts):

Financial Instruments 

Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities 

All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. The Company&#146;s marketable debt and equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase and reevaluates the designations at each balance sheet date. The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument&#146;s underlying contractual maturity date. Marketable debt securities with maturities of 12 months or less are classified as short-term and marketable debt securities with maturities greater than 12 months are classified as long-term. The Company classifies its marketable equity securities, including mutual funds, as either short-term or long-term based on the nature of each security and its availability for use in current operations. The Company&#146;s marketable debt and equity securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of shareholders&#146; equity. The cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method. 

Derivative Financial Instruments 

The Company accounts for its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value. 

For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (&#147;AOCI&#148;) in shareholders&#146; equity and reclassified into income in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument, if any, is recognized in current income. To receive hedge accounting treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in income. For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability and that are designated as fair value hedges, both the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the current period. The Company had no fair value 

&#160; 

hedges in 2012, 2011 and 2010. The net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative instrument that is designated as an economic hedge of the foreign currency translation exposure of the net investment in a foreign operation is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. For forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or losses related to this component are recognized in current income. Derivatives that do not qualify as hedges must be adjusted to fair value through current income. 

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 

The Company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors. The Company considers historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of the Company&#146;s customers, current economic conditions, and other factors that may affect customers&#146; ability to pay. 

Inventories 

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, computed using the first-in, first-out method, or market. If the cost of the inventories exceeds their market value, provisions are made currently for the difference between the cost and the market value. The Company&#146;s inventories consist primarily of components and finished goods for all periods presented. 

Property, Plant and Equipment 

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by use of the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the underlying building; between two to five years for machinery and equipment, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; and the shorter of lease terms or ten years for leasehold improvements. The Company capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years. Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $2.6 billion, $1.6 billion and $815 million during 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 

Long-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets 

The Company reviews property, plant and equipment, inventory component prepayments, and certain identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If property, plant and equipment, inventory component prepayments, and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. The Company did not record any significant impairments during 2012, 2011 and 2010. 

The Company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, rather such assets are required to be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. The Company performs its goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. The Company did not recognize any impairment charges related to goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets during 2012, 2011 and 2010. The Company established reporting units based on its current reporting structure. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit. In 2012 and 2011, the Company&#146;s goodwill was allocated to the Americas and Europe reportable operating segments. 

&#160; 

The Company amortizes its intangible assets with definite lives over their estimated useful lives and reviews these assets for impairment. The Company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods typically from three to seven years. 

Fair Value Measurements 

The Company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement: 

Level 1 &#150; Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2 &#150; Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 

Level 3 &#150; Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management&#146;s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. 

The Company&#146;s valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities were derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of all other financial instruments, all of which have counterparties with high credit ratings, were valued based on quoted market prices or model driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. 

In accordance with the fair value accounting requirements, companies may choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The Company has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments. 

Foreign Currency Translation and Remeasurement 

The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are recognized in foreign currency translation included in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders&#146; equity. The Company&#146;s subsidiaries that use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, and inventories, property, and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates. Gains and losses from these remeasurements were not significant and have been included in the Company&#146;s results of operations.

&#160; ##TABLE_END &#160; 

The net unrealized gains as of September 29, 2012 and September 24, 2011 are related primarily to long-term marketable securities. The Company may sell certain of its marketable securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic reasons including, but not limited to, anticipation of credit deterioration and duration management. The net realized gains or losses recognized during 2012 and 2011 were $183 million and $110 million, respectively, and no significant net realized gains or losses during 2010 related to such sales. The maturities of the Company&#146;s long-term marketable securities generally range from one to five years. 

As of September 29, 2012 and September 24, 2011, gross unrealized losses related to individual securities that had been in a continuous loss position for 12 months or longer were not significant. 

As of September 29, 2012, the Company considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities investment portfolio to be temporary in nature and does not consider any of its investments other-than-temporarily impaired. The Company typically invests in highly-rated securities, and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy requires investments generally to be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating an investment for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below its cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, and the Company&#146;s intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell, the investment before recovery of the investment&#146;s cost basis. During 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company did not recognize any significant impairment charges. 

Derivative Financial Instruments 

The Company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset some of the foreign exchange risk on expected future cash flows on certain forecasted revenue and cost of sales, on net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and on certain existing assets and liabilities. 

To help protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company&#146;s subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue. The Company&#146;s subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar and who sell in local currencies may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries&#146; functional currencies. The Company typically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases generally up to six months. 

To help protect the net investment in a foreign operation from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 

The Company may also enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign currency exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange rates. 

The Company records all derivatives in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The Company&#146;s accounting treatment of these instruments is based on whether the instruments are designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. The effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The effective portions of net investment hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment. The ineffective portions of cash flow hedges and net 

&#160; 

investment hedges are recorded in other income and expense. Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the financial statement line item to which the derivative relates. 

The Company had a net deferred loss associated with cash flow hedges of approximately $240 million and a net deferred gain of approximately $290 million, net of taxes, recorded in AOCI as of September 29, 2012 and September 24, 2011, respectively. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. The majority of the Company&#146;s hedged transactions as of September 29, 2012 are expected to occur within six months. 

Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified immediately into other income and expense. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are reflected in other income and expense unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. The Company did not recognize any significant net gains or losses related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges during 2012, 2011 and 2010. 

The Company&#146;s unrealized net gains and losses on net investment hedges, included in the cumulative translation adjustment account of AOCI, were not significant as of September 29, 2012 and September 24, 2011, respectively. The ineffective portions of and amounts excluded from the effectiveness test of net investment hedges are recorded in other income and expense. 

The gain/loss recognized in other income and expense for foreign currency forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments was not significant during 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. These amounts represent the net gain or loss on the derivative contracts and do not include changes in the related exposures, which generally offset a portion of the gain or loss on the derivative contracts. 

The following table shows the notional principal amounts of the Company&#146;s outstanding derivative instruments and credit risk amounts associated with outstanding or unsettled derivative instruments as of September 29, 2012 and September 24, 2011 (in millions):

The credit risk amounts represent the Company&#146;s gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency exchange rates at each respective date. The Company&#146;s gross exposure on these transactions may be further mitigated by collateral received from certain counterparties. The Company&#146;s exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as a function of currency exchange rates. Although the table above reflects the notional principal and credit risk amounts of the Company&#146;s foreign exchange 

&#160; 

instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the foreign exchange instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. 

The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values. As of September 29, 2012, the Company posted cash collateral related to the derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements of $278 million, which it recorded as other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of September 24, 2011, the Company received cash collateral related to the derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements of $288 million, which it recorded as accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company did not have any derivative instruments with credit-risk related contingent features that would require it to post additional collateral as of September 29, 2012 or September 24, 2011.

##TABLE_END Accounts Receivable 

Trade Receivables 

The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, value-added resellers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. 

As of September 29, 2012, the Company had two customers that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, one of which accounted for 14% and the other 10%. As of September 24, 2011, there were no customers that accounted for 10% or more of the Company&#146;s total trade receivables. The Company&#146;s cellular network carriers accounted for 66% and 52% of trade receivables as of September 29, 2012 and September 24, 2011, respectively. The additions and write-offs to the Company&#146;s allowance for doubtful accounts during 2012, 2011 and 2010 were not significant. 

&#160; 

Vendor Non-Trade Receivables 

The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. Vendor non-trade receivables from three of the Company&#146;s vendors accounted for 45%, 21% and 12% of total non-trade receivables as of September 29, 2012 and vendor non-trade receivables from two of the Company&#146;s vendors accounted for 53% and 29% of total non-trade receivables as of September 24, 2011. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in net sales and does not recognize any profits on these sales until the related products are sold by the Company, at which time any profit is recognized as a reduction of cost of sales.

&#160; ##TABLE_END The foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pretax earnings of $36.8 billion, $24.0 billion and $13.0 billion in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements provide for any related tax liability on amounts that may be repatriated, aside from undistributed earnings of certain of the Company&#146;s foreign subsidiaries that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the U.S. As of September 29, 2012, U.S. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $40.4 billion of such earnings. The amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these temporary differences is estimated to be approximately $13.8 billion. 

As of September 29, 2012 and September 24, 2011, $82.6 billion and $54.3 billion, respectively, of the Company&#146;s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. 

A reconciliation of the provision for income taxes, with the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate (35% in 2012, 2011 and 2010) to income before provision for income taxes for 2012, 2011, and 2010, is as follows (in millions):

For RSUs, the Company receives an income tax benefit upon the award&#146;s vesting equal to the tax effect of the underlying stock&#146;s fair market value. The Company had net excess tax benefits from equity awards of $1.4 billion, $1.1 billion and $742 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, which were reflected as increases to common stock.

&#160; ##TABLE_END Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax losses, credits, and the future income tax effects of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. 

Uncertain Tax Positions 

Tax positions are evaluated in a two-step process. The Company first determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination. If a tax position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold it is then measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company classifies gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year as non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

As of September 29, 2012, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $2.1 billion, of which $889 million, if recognized, would affect the Company&#146;s effective tax rate. As of September 24, 2011, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $1.4 billion, of which $563 million, if recognized, would affect the Company&#146;s effective tax rate. 

&#160; 

The aggregate changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, for 2012, 2011, and 2010, is as follows (in millions):

&#160; ##TABLE_END The Company includes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes. As of September 29, 2012 and September 24, 2011, the total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $401 million and $261 million, respectively, which is classified as non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In connection with tax matters, the Company recognized interest expense in 2012 and 2011 of $140 million and $14 million, respectively, and in 2010 the Company recognized an interest benefit of $43 million. 

The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, all years prior to 2004 are closed. The Internal Revenue Service (the &#147;IRS&#148;) has completed its field audit of the Company&#146;s federal income tax returns for the years 2004 through 2006 and proposed certain adjustments. The Company has contested certain of these adjustments through the IRS Appeals Office. The IRS is currently examining the years 2007 through 2009. In addition, the Company is also subject to audits by state, local and foreign tax authorities. In major states and major foreign jurisdictions, the years subsequent to 1989 and 2002, respectively, generally remain open and could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities. 

Management believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company&#146;s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management&#146;s expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs. Although timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could reduce its unrecognized tax benefits by between $120 million and $170 million in the next 12 months. 

Note 6 &#150; Shareholders&#146; Equity and Share-based Compensation 

Preferred Stock 

The Company has five million shares of authorized preferred stock, none of which is issued or outstanding. Under the terms of the Company&#146;s Restated Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Directors is authorized to determine or alter the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the Company&#146;s authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock. 

Dividend and Stock Repurchase Program 

In 2012, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a dividend policy pursuant to which it plans to make, subject to subsequent declaration, quarterly dividends of $2.65 per share. On July 24, 2012, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $2.65 per share to shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 13, 2012. The Company paid $2.5 billion in conjunction with this dividend on August 16, 2012. No dividends were declared in the first three quarters of 2012 or in 2011 and 2010 . 

&#160; 

In 2012, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $10 billion of the Company&#146;s common stock beginning in 2013. The repurchase program is expected to be executed over a three-year period with the primary objective of neutralizing the impact of dilution from future employee equity grants and employee stock purchase programs. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares. In August 2012, the Company entered into a Rule 10b5-1 compliant accelerated share repurchase (&#147;ASR&#148;) program with a financial institution to purchase up to $2 billion of the Company&#146;s common stock during 2013. The total number of shares to be purchased under the ASR program will be based on the volume-weighted average price of the Company&#146;s common stock during the purchase period and will be reflected as a reduction of shares outstanding on the date of purchase. The Company may also purchase its common stock in open market transactions, in compliance with all applicable securities laws. 

Comprehensive Income 

Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, and gains and losses that under GAAP are recorded as an element of shareholders&#146; equity but are excluded from net income. The Company&#146;s other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities classified as available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges. 

The following table shows the components of AOCI, net of taxes, as of September 29, 2012 and September 24, 2011 (in millions):

Employee Benefit Plans 

2003 Employee Stock Plan 

The 2003 Employee Stock Plan (the &#147;2003 Plan&#148;) is a shareholder approved plan that provides for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers. The 2003 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, RSUs, stock appreciation rights, stock purchase rights and performance-based awards. Options granted under the 2003 Plan generally expire seven to ten years after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of four years, based on continued employment, with either annual, semi-annual or quarterly vesting. In general, RSUs granted under the 2003 Plan vest over two to four years, based on continued employment and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company&#146;s common stock on a one-for-one basis. Each share issued with respect to an award granted under the 2003 Plan (other than a stock option or stock appreciation right) reduces the number of shares available for grant under the plan by two shares, whereas shares issued in respect of an option or stock appreciation right count against the number of shares available for grant on a one-for-one basis. All RSUs, other than RSUs held by the Chief Executive Officer, granted under the 2003 Plan have dividend equivalent rights (&#147;DER&#148;), which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. DER are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DER are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. As of September 29, 2012, approximately 37.1 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the 2003 Plan. 

1997 Director Stock Plan 

The 1997 Director Stock Plan (the &#147;Director Plan&#148;) is a shareholder approved plan that (i) permits the Company to grant awards of RSUs or stock options to the Company&#146;s non-employee directors, (ii) provides for automatic initial grants of RSUs upon a non-employee director joining the Board of Directors and automatic annual grants of RSUs at each annual meeting of shareholders, and (iii) permits the Board of Directors to prospectively change the relative mixture of stock options and RSUs for the initial and annual award grants and the methodology for determining the number of shares of the Company&#146;s common stock subject to these grants without shareholder approval. Each share issued with respect to RSUs granted under the Director Plan reduces the number of shares available for grant under the plan by two shares. The Director Plan expires November 9, 2019. All RSUs granted under the Director Plan are entitled to DER. As of September 29, 2012, approximately 184,000 shares were reserved for future issuance under the Director Plan. 

Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans 

During the fourth quarter of 2012, executive officers Timothy D. Cook, Peter Oppenheimer, D. Bruce Sewell, Phillip W. Schiller and Jeffrey E. Williams, and directors William V. Campbell and Arthur D. Levinson had equity trading plans adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;). An equity trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or a formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Company&#146;s stock, including shares acquired pursuant to the Company&#146;s employee and director equity plans. 

Employee Stock Purchase Plan 

The Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the &#147;Purchase Plan&#148;) is a shareholder approved plan under which substantially all employees may purchase the Company&#146;s common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values of the stock as of the beginning or the end of six-month offering periods. An employee&#146;s payroll deductions under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of the employee&#146;s compensation and employees may not purchase more than $25,000 of stock during any calendar year. As of September 29, 2012, approximately 2.5 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan. 

&#160; 

401(k) Plan 

The Company&#146;s 401(k) Plan (the &#147;401(k) Plan&#148;) is a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the IRS annual contribution limit ($17,000 for calendar year 2012). The Company matches 50% to 100% of each employee&#146;s contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the employee&#146;s eligible earnings. The Company&#146;s matching contributions to the 401(k) Plan were $114 million, $90 million and $72 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

&#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $3.3 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.0 billion for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The majority of RSUs that vested in 2012, 2011 and 2010 were net-share settled such that the Company withheld shares with value equivalent to the employees&#146; minimum statutory obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were approximately 2.3 million, 1.6 million and 1.8 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and were based on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as determined by the Company&#146;s closing stock price. Total payments for the employees&#146; tax obligations to taxing authorities were $1.2 billion, $520 million and $406 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. These net-share settlements had the effect of share repurchases by the Company as they reduced and retired the number of shares that would have otherwise been issued as a result of the vesting and did not represent an expense to the Company.

Total intrinsic value of options at time of exercise was $2.3 billion, $2.6 billion and $2.0 billion for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 

Share-based Compensation 

Share-based compensation cost for RSUs is measured based on the closing fair market value of the Company&#146;s common stock on the date of grant. Share-based compensation cost for stock options and employee stock purchase plan rights (&#147;stock purchase rights&#148;) is estimated at the grant date and offering date, respectively, based on the fair-value as calculated by the BSM option-pricing model. The BSM option-pricing model incorporates various assumptions including expected volatility, estimated expected life and interest rates. The Company recognizes share-based compensation cost as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. 

The Company did not grant any stock options during 2012. The Company granted 1,370 and 34,000 stock options during 2011 and 2010, respectively. The weighted-average grant date fair value per share of stock options granted during 2011 and 2010 was $181.13 and $108.58, respectively. 

During 2012 and 2010, in conjunction with certain business combinations, the Company assumed 41,000 and 98,000 stock options, respectively, which had a weighted-average fair value per share of $405.39 and $216.82, respectively. The Company did not assume any stock options during 2011. 

The weighted-average fair value of stock purchase rights per share was $108.44, $71.47 and $45.03 during 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Note 7 &#150; Commitments and Contingencies 

Accrued Warranty and Indemnification 

The Company offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products. The basic warranty period for hardware products is typically one year from the date of purchase by the end-user. The Company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the Company&#146;s hardware products. The Company provides currently for the estimated cost that may be incurred under its basic limited product warranties at the time related revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals for product warranty obligations include the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection, historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Company&#146;s typical experience. The Company assesses the adequacy of its pre-existing warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates. 

The following table shows changes in the Company&#146;s accrued warranties and related costs for 2012, 2011, and 2010 (in millions): 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; &#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; &#160;

&#160;

&#160; ##TABLE_END The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a potential liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results. Therefore, the Company did not record a liability for infringement costs related to indemnification as of either September 29, 2012 or September 24, 2011. 

The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such 

&#160; 

individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. However, the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations, and payments made under these agreements historically have not been material. 

Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product 

Although most components essential to the Company&#146;s business are generally available from multiple sources, a number of components are currently obtained from single or limited sources, which subjects the Company to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. In addition, the Company has entered into various agreements for the supply of components; however there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. 

The Company and other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. The Company also uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers&#146; yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the Company&#146;s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company&#146;s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Company&#146;s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers concentrated on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company&#146;s requirements. 

Substantially all of the Company&#146;s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these outsourcing partners are the sole-sourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the Company&#146;s products. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Company&#146;s operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. The Company&#146;s purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days. 

Long-Term Supply Agreements 

The Company has entered into long-term agreements to secure the supply of certain inventory components. Under certain of these agreements, which expire between 2012 and 2022, the Company has made prepayments for the future purchase of inventory components and has acquired capital equipment to use in the manufacturing of such components. 

As of September 29, 2012, the Company had a total of $4.2 billion of inventory component prepayments outstanding, of which $1.2 billion are classified as other current assets and $3.0 billion are classified as other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company had a total of $2.3 billion of inventory component prepayments outstanding as of September 24, 2011. The Company&#146;s outstanding prepayments will be applied to certain inventory component purchases made during the term of each respective agreement. The Company utilized $943 million and $173 million of inventory component prepayments during 2012 and 2011, respectively. 

&#160; 

Other Off-Balance Sheet Commitments 

Lease Commitments 

The Company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company does not currently utilize any other off-balance sheet financing arrangements. The major facility leases are typically for terms not exceeding 10 years and generally provide renewal options for terms not exceeding five additional years. Leases for retail space are for terms ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of September 29, 2012, the Company&#146;s total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $4.4 billion, of which $3.1 billion related to leases for retail space. 

Rent expense under all operating leases, including both cancelable and noncancelable leases, was $488 million, $338 million and $271 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases having remaining terms in excess of one year as of September 29, 2012, are as follows (in millions):

&#160; ##TABLE_END Other Commitments 

As of September 29, 2012, the Company had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of $21.1 billion. 

In addition to the off-balance sheet commitments mentioned above, the Company had outstanding obligations of $988 million as of September 29, 2012, which were comprised mainly of commitments to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and commitments related to advertising, research and development, Internet and telecommunications services and other obligations. 

Contingencies 

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not been fully adjudicated, certain of which are discussed in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading &#147;Legal Proceedings&#148; and in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading &#147;Risk Factors.&#148; In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies. However, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management&#146;s expectations, the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. 

Apple Inc. vs Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd, et al. 

On August 24, 2012, a jury returned a verdict awarding the Company $1.05 billion in its lawsuit against Samsung Electronics and affiliated parties in the United States District Court, Northern District of California, San Jose Division. Because the award is subject to entry of final judgment and may be subject to appeal, the Company has not recognized the award in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 29, 2012. 

&#160; 

Note 8 &#150; Segment Information and Geographic Data 

The Company reports segment information based on the &#147;management&#148; approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company&#146;s reportable segments. 

The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. Accordingly, the Company determined its reportable operating segments, which are generally based on the nature and location of its customers, to be the Americas, Europe, Japan, Asia-Pacific and Retail. The results of the Americas, Europe, Japan and Asia-Pacific segments do not include results of the Retail segment. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries, as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Asia-Pacific segment includes Australia and Asian countries, other than Japan. The Retail segment operates Apple retail stores in 13 countries, including the U.S. Each operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, &#147;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.&#148; 

The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers, while Retail segment net sales are based on sales from the Company&#146;s retail stores. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the operating segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses, such as manufacturing costs and variances not included in standard costs, research and development, corporate marketing expenses, share-based compensation expense, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges, and other separately managed general and administrative costs. Prior to 2012, the Company allocated to corporate expenses certain costs associated with its high-profile retail stores that have been designed and built to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. Beginning in 2012, the Company no longer allocates these costs to corporate expenses and reclassified $102 million and $75 million of such costs from corporate to Retail segment expenses for 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes. 

Segment assets include receivables and inventories, and for the Retail segment also includes capital assets. Segment assets exclude corporate assets, such as cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term marketable securities, vendor non-trade receivables, other long-term investments, manufacturing and corporate facilities, product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets. Except for the Retail segment, capital asset purchases for long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment and therefore are excluded from the geographic segment assets and instead included in corporate assets. Cash payments for capital asset purchases by the Retail segment were $858 million, $612 million and $392 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company&#146;s total depreciation and amortization was $3.3 billion, $1.8 billion and $1.0 billion in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, of which $319 million, $273 million and $198 million was related to the Retail segment in the respective years. Depreciation and amortization on segment assets included in the geographic segments was not significant.

Report of Ernst &#38; Young LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Apple Inc. 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of September 29, 2012 and September 24, 2011, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders&#146; equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2012. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Apple Inc. at September 29, 2012 and September 24, 2011, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2012, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Apple Inc.&#146;s internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#150; Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated October 31, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Ernst &#38; Young LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Apple Inc. 

We have audited Apple Inc.&#146;s internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#150; Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (&#147;the COSO criteria&#148;). Apple Inc.&#146;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management&#146;s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

In our opinion, Apple Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2012, based on the COSO criteria. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the 2012 consolidated financial statements of Apple Inc. and our report dated October 31, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
