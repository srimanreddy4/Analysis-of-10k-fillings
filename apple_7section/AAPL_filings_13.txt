Executive Overview 

The Company designs, manufactures, and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, and portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and applications. The Company&#146;s products and services include iPhone, iPad, Mac, iPod, Apple TV, a portfolio of consumer and professional software applications, the iOS and Mac OS X operating systems, iCloud, and a variety of accessory, service and support offerings. The Company also sells and delivers digital content and applications through the iTunes Store, App Store, iBookstore, and Mac App Store. The Company sells its products worldwide through its retail stores, online stores, and direct sales force, as well as through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party iPhone, iPad, Mac and iPod compatible products, including application software, printers, storage devices, speakers, headphones, and various other accessories and peripherals through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers. 

The Company is committed to bringing the best user experience to its customers through its innovative hardware, software, peripherals, and services. The Company&#146;s business strategy leverages its unique ability to design and develop its own operating systems, hardware, application software, and services to provide its customers new products and solutions with superior ease-of-use, seamless integration, and innovative design. As part of its strategy, the Company continues to expand its platform for the discovery and delivery of third-party digital content and applications through the iTunes Store. As part of the iTunes Store, the Company&#146;s App Store and iBookstore allow customers to discover and download applications and books through either a Mac or Windows-based computer or through &#147;iOS devices,&#148; namely iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. In January 2011, the Company opened the Mac App Store to allow customers to easily discover, download and install applications for their Macs. The Company also supports a community for the development of third-party software and hardware products and digital content that complement the Company&#146;s offerings. The Company&#146;s strategy also includes expanding its distribution network to effectively reach more customers and provide them with a high-quality sales and post-sales support experience. 

The Company participates in several highly competitive markets, including mobile communications and media devices with its iPhone, iPad and iPod product families; personal computers with its Mac computers; and distribution of third-party digital content and applications through the iTunes Store, App Store, iBookstore, and Mac App Store. While the Company is widely recognized as a leading innovator in the markets where it competes, these markets are highly competitive and subject to aggressive pricing. To remain competitive, the Company believes that continual investment in research and development and marketing and advertising is critical to the development and sale of innovative products and technologies. The Company&#146;s research and development spending is focused on investing in new hardware and software products, and in further developing its existing products, including iPhone, iPad, Mac, and iPod hardware; iOS and Mac OS X operating systems; and a variety of application software and online services. 

&#160; 

The Company uses a variety of direct and indirect distribution channels, such as its retail stores, online stores, and direct sales force, and third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, and value-added resellers. The Company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the hardware and software integration, and demonstrate the unique solutions that are available on its products. The Company further believes providing direct contact with its targeted customers is an effective way to demonstrate the advantages of its products over those of its competitors and providing a high-quality sales and after-sales support experience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing customers. To ensure a high-quality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized, the Company continues to expand and improve its distribution capabilities by expanding the number of its own retail stores worldwide. Additionally, the Company has invested in programs to enhance reseller sales by placing high quality Apple fixtures, merchandising materials and other resources within selected third-party reseller locations. Through the Apple Premium Reseller Program, certain third-party resellers focus on the Apple platform by providing a high level of integration and support services, and product expertise. 

Japan Earthquake and Tsunami and Thailand Flooding 

On March 11, 2011, the northeast coast of Japan experienced a severe earthquake followed by a tsunami, with continuing aftershocks. These geological events have caused significant damage in the region, including severe damage to nuclear power plants, and have impacted Japan&#146;s power and other infrastructure as well as its economy. Certain of the Company&#146;s suppliers are located in Japan, and certain of its other suppliers integrate components or use materials manufactured in Japan in the production of its products. To the extent that component production has been affected, the Company has generally obtained alternative sources of supply or implemented other measures. The Company does not currently believe these events will have a material impact on its operations in the first quarter of 2012 unless conditions worsen, including, but not limited to, power outages and expansion of evacuation zones around the nuclear power plants. 

Beyond the first quarter of 2012, uncertainty exists with respect to the availability of electrical power, the damage to nuclear power plants and the impact to other infrastructure. Thus, there is a risk that the Company could in the future experience delays or other constraints in obtaining key components and products and/or price increases related to such components and products that could materially adversely affect the Company&#146;s financial condition and operating results. 

In addition, in recent months several regions of Thailand have experienced severe flooding, causing damage to infrastructure, housing and factories. A number of the Company&#146;s suppliers are located in Thailand. As with Japan, to the extent that component production has been affected, the Company will work to obtain alternative sources of supply or implement other measures. Based on the Company&#146;s current assessment of the situation, it does not believe this event will have a material impact on its operations in the first quarter of 2012; however, because the situation in Thailand is still evolving uncertainty remains regarding the ultimate impact of this event on the Company. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#147;GAAP&#148;) and the Company&#146;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company&#146;s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1, &#147;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#148; of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material. 

&#160; 

Management believes the Company&#146;s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, valuation and impairment of marketable securities, inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments, warranty costs, income taxes, and legal and other contingencies. Management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Company&#146;s financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. The Company&#146;s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Company&#146;s Board of Directors. 

Revenue Recognition 

Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, peripherals, and service and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Company&#146;s product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers recognition of revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware, and third-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i) standalone sales of software products, (ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware. 

For multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product&#146;s functionality, undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware product&#146;s essential software, and undelivered non-software services, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the Company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (&#147;VSOE&#148;), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (&#147;TPE&#148;) and (iii) best estimate of the selling price (&#147;ESP&#148;). VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable. ESPs reflect the Company&#146;s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. 

For sales of iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, for sales of iPod touch beginning in June 2010, and for sales of Mac beginning in June 2011, the Company has indicated it may from time-to-time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to customers. In June 2011, the Company announced it would begin providing various non-software services to owners of qualifying versions of iOS devices and Mac. Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for these unspecified software upgrade rights or the non-software services, revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the Company&#146;s ESPs. Amounts allocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated lives of each of these devices, which range from 24 to 48 months. The Company&#146;s process for determining ESPs involves management&#146;s judgment. The Company&#146;s process considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. If the facts and circumstances underlying the factors considered change, including the estimated or actual costs incurred to provide non-software services or the estimated lives of the related devices, or should future facts and circumstances lead the Company to consider additional factors, the Company&#146;s ESP for software upgrades and non-software services related to future sales of these devices could change. If the estimated life of one or more of the devices should change, the future rate of amortization of the revenue allocated to the software upgrade rights would also change. 

&#160; 

The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. For transactions involving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. The Company&#146;s policy requires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. For customer incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company&#146;s historical experience. Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result in additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs are offered. Additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. Management&#146;s estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives, the Company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have a negative impact on the Company&#146;s results of operations. 

Valuation and Impairment of Marketable Securities 

The Company&#146;s investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, in the Company&#146;s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities impact the Company&#146;s net income only when such securities are sold or an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security&#146;s cost basis. The Company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would require the Company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this judgment, the Company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, and the Company&#146;s intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell, the security before recovery of the its amortized cost basis. The Company&#146;s assessment on whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired, could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security. 

Inventory Valuation and Inventory Purchase Commitments 

The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. The Company records a write-down for inventories of components and products, including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, and component cost trends. The industries in which the Company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. If future demand or market conditions for the Company&#146;s products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory, the Company may be required to record additional write-downs, which would negatively affect its results of operations in the period when the write-downs were recorded. 

The Company records accruals for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. These commitments typically cover the Company&#146;s requirements for periods up to 150 days. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Company&#146;s products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Company&#146;s products, the Company may be required to 

&#160; 

record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would negatively affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded. 

Warranty Costs 

The Company provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Company&#146;s typical experience. Each quarter, the Company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary. If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could materially affect the Company&#146;s results of operations. 

Income Taxes 

The Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. The provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. 

The Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. 

Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. In the event that the Company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the Company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of GAAP and complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management&#146;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#146;s financial condition and operating results. 

Legal and Other Contingencies 

As discussed in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading &#147;Legal Proceedings&#148; and in Note 7, &#147;Commitments and Contingencies&#148; in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. There is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies. However, the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company are subject to significant uncertainty. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in the same reporting period for amounts in excess of management&#146;s expectations, the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. 

&#160;

Fiscal Year 2011 versus 2010 

Net sales during 2011 increased $43.0 billion or 66% compared to 2010. Several factors contributed positively to this increase, including the following: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Net sales of iPhone and related products and services were $47.1 billion in 2011, representing an increase of $21.9 billion or 87% compared to 2010. iPhone handset unit sales totaled 72.3 million during 2011, representing an increase of 32.3 million units or 81% compared to 2010. iPhone year-over-year net sales growth reflected strong demand for iPhone 4 in all of the Company&#146;s operating segments. The expanded U.S. distribution of iPhone to the Verizon Wireless network beginning in February 2011, continued expansion into new countries, and increased distribution with other new carriers and resellers also contributed to the year-over-year growth of iPhone. As of September 24, 2011, the Company distributed iPhone in 105 countries through 228 carriers. Additionally, the Company distributes iPhone through its direct channels and certain third-party resellers. Net sales of iPhone and related products and services accounted for 43% of the Company&#146;s total net sales for 2011. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Net sales of iPad and related products and services, which the Company introduced in the third quarter of 2010, were $20.4 billion in 2011, representing an increase of $15.4 billion or 311% compared to 2010. Unit sales of iPad were 32.4 million during 2011, an increase of 334% from 2010. The year-over-year unit growth and net sales growth were driven by strong iPad demand in all of the Company&#146;s operating segments. The Company distributes iPad through its direct channels, certain cellular network carriers&#146; distribution channels and certain third-party resellers. The Company distributed iPad in 90 countries as of September 24, 2011 compared to 26 countries as of September 25, 2010. Net sales of iPad and related products and services accounted for 19% of the Company&#146;s total net sales for 2011. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Mac net sales were $21.8 billion in 2011, representing an increase of $4.3 billion or 25% compared to 2010. Mac unit sales increased by 3.1 million or 22% in 2011 compared to 2010. The year-over-year growth in Mac net sales and unit sales was due primarily to higher demand in all of the Company&#146;s operating segments for MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, which were updated in July 2011 and February 2011, respectively. The year-over-year revenue growth for portables and desktops was 36% and 4%, respectively. Net sales of the Company&#146;s Macs accounted for 20% of the Company&#146;s total net sales for 2011. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Net sales of other music related products and services were $6.3 billion in 2011, representing an increase of $1.4 billion or 28% compared to 2010. The increase was due primarily to increased net sales from the iTunes Store, which was largely driven by App Store expansion into new countries that contributed to strong growth in all of the Company&#146;s geographic segments. During 2011, the combined net sales for the iTunes Store, App Store and iBookstore was $5.4 billion, representing an increase of 33% compared to 2010. The Company believes this continued growth is the result of heightened consumer interest in downloading third-party digital content, continued growth in its customer base of iPhone, iPad and iPod, expansion of third-party audio and video content available via the iTunes Store, and continued interest in and growth of the App Store. Net sales of other music related products and services accounted for 6% of the Company&#146;s total net sales for 2011. 

##TABLE_END Partially offsetting the positive factors contributing to the overall increase in net sales was a decrease in iPod net sales of $821 million or 10% during 2011 compared to 2010. Similarly, iPod unit sales decreased by 15% in 2011 compared to 2010. However, net sales per iPod unit sold increased during 2011 compared to 2010 due primarily to a shift in iPod product mix toward iPod touch. Net sales of iPod accounted for 7% of the Company&#146;s total net sales for 2011. 

&#160; 

Fiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 

Net sales during 2010 increased $22.3 billion or 52% compared to 2009. Several factors contributed positively to this increase, including the following: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Net sales of iPhone and related products and services were $25.2 billion in 2010 representing an increase of $12.1 billion or 93% compared to 2009. iPhone unit sales totaled 40 million in 2010, which represents an increase of 19.3 million or 93% compared to 2009. iPhone year-over-year growth was attributable primarily to continued growth from existing carriers, expanded distribution with new international carriers and resellers, and strong demand for iPhone 4, which was released in the U.S. in June 2010 and in many other countries over the remainder of 2010. As of September 25, 2010, the Company distributed iPhone in 89 countries through 166 carriers. Net sales of iPhone and related products and services accounted for 39% of the Company&#146;s total net sales for 2010 compared to 30% in 2009. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Net sales of iPad and related products and services were $5.0 billion and unit sales of iPad were 7.5 million during 2010. iPad was released in the U.S. in April 2010 and in various other countries over the remainder of 2010. As of September 25, 2010, the Company distributed iPad in 26 countries. The Company distributes iPad through its direct channels, certain cellular network carriers&#146; distribution channels and certain third-party resellers. Net sales of iPad and related products and services accounted for 8% of the Company&#146;s total net sales for 2010, reflecting the strong demand for iPad during the five months following its release. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Mac net sales increased by $3.6 billion or 26% in 2010 compared to 2009, and Mac unit sales increased by 3.3 million or 31% in 2010 compared to 2009. Net sales per Mac unit sold decreased by 4% in 2010 compared to 2009 due primarily to lower average selling prices of Mac portable systems. During 2010, net sales and unit sales of the Company&#146;s Mac portable systems increased by 18% and 25%, respectively, primarily attributable to strong demand for MacBook Pro, which was updated in April 2010. Net sales and unit sales of the Company&#146;s Mac desktop systems increased by 43% and 45%, respectively, as a result of higher sales of iMac, which was updated in July 2010. Net sales of the Company&#146;s Macs accounted for 27% of the Company&#146;s total net sales in 2010 compared to 32% in 2009. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Net sales of other music related products and services increased $912 million or 23% during 2010 compared to 2009. This increase was due primarily to growth of the iTunes Store which generated total net sales of $4.1 billion for 2010. The results of the iTunes Store reflect growth of the iTunes App Store, continued growth in the installed base of iPhone, iPad, and iPod customers, and the expansion of third-party audio and video content available for sale and rent via the iTunes Store. The Company continues to expand its iTunes content and applications offerings around the world. Net sales of other music related products and services accounted for 8% of the Company&#146;s total net sales for 2010 compared to 9% in 2009. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Net sales of iPods increased $183 million or 2% during 2010, while iPod unit sales declined by 7% during 2010 compared to 2009. Net sales per iPod unit sold increased by 10% to $164 in 2010 compared to 2009, due to a shift in product mix toward iPod touch. iPod touch experienced strong growth in each of the Company&#146;s reportable operating segments. Net sales of iPods accounted for 13% of the Company&#146;s total net sales for 2010 compared to 19% in 2009. 

##TABLE_END Segment Operating Performance 

The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company&#146;s reportable operating segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Japan, Asia-Pacific and Retail operations. The results of the Americas, Europe, Japan and Asia-Pacific reportable segments do not include the results of the Retail segment. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries, as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Asia-Pacific segment includes Australia and Asian 

&#160; 

countries, other than Japan. The Retail segment operates Apple retail stores in 11 countries. Each reportable operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services. Further information regarding the Company&#146;s operating segments may be found in Note 8, &#147;Segment Information and Geographic Data&#148; in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K. 

Americas 

During 2011, net sales in the Americas segment increased $13.8 billion or 56% compared to 2010. The primary contributors to the growth in net sales was a significant year-over-year increase in iPhone revenue from carrier expansion and strong demand for iPhone 4 and increased sales of iPad and Macs, partially offset by a decrease in iPod net sales. Higher sales of third-party digital content and applications from the iTunes Store and App Store also drove an increase in sales during 2011. The Americas segment represented approximately 35% and 37% of the Company&#146;s total net sales for 2011 and 2010, respectively. 

During 2010, net sales in the Americas segment increased $5.5 billion or 29% compared to 2009. This increase in net sales was driven by increased iPhone revenue, strong demand for iPad, continued demand for Mac desktop and portable systems, and higher sales of third-party digital content and applications from the iTunes Store. The Americas segment represented 37% and 44% of the Company&#146;s total net sales in 2010 and 2009, respectively. 

Europe 

For 2011, net sales in the Europe segment increased $9.1 billion or 49%, compared to 2010. The increase in net sales during 2011 was attributable primarily to the continued year-over-year increase in iPhone revenue from carrier expansion and strong demand for iPhone 4, and increased sales of iPad and Macs, partially offset by a decrease in iPod net sales. The Europe segment represented 26% and 29% of total net sales for 2011 and 2010, respectively. 

During 2010, net sales in Europe increased $6.9 billion or 58% compared to 2009. The growth in net sales was due mainly to a significant increase in iPhone revenue attributable to continued growth from existing carriers and country and carrier expansion, increased sales of Mac desktop and portable systems and strong demand for iPad, partially offset by a stronger U.S. dollar. The Europe segment represented 29% and 28% of the Company&#146;s total net sales in 2010 and 2009, respectively. 

Japan 

Japan&#146;s net sales increased $1.5 billion or 37% during 2011 compared to 2010. The key contributors to Japan&#146;s net sales growth were increased iPhone revenue, strong sales of iPad, increased sales of Macs, and strength in the Japanese Yen relative to the U.S. dollar. The Japan segment represented 5% and 6% of total net sales for 2011 and 2010, respectively. 

The recent earthquakes and tsunami that struck the northeast coast of Japan have created uncertainty regarding general economic and market conditions in Japan. Any significant impact of these events on consumer demand could negatively impact the Company&#146;s net sales in Japan in the future. The Company does not currently believe that the impact of these events will have a material adverse effect on the Company or its results of operations. 

During 2010, Japan&#146;s net sales increased $1.7 billion or 75% compared to 2009. The primary contributors to this growth were significant year-over-year increases in iPhone revenue, strong demand for iPad, and to a lesser extent strength in the Japanese Yen. The Japan segment represented 6% and 5% of the Company&#146;s total net sales for 2010 and 2009, respectively. 

&#160; 

Asia-Pacific 

Net sales in the Asia Pacific segment increased $14.3 billion or 174% during 2011 compared to 2010. The Company experienced particularly strong year-over-year net sales growth in its Asia Pacific segment during 2011, especially in Greater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan. Korea and Australia also experienced strong year-over-year revenue growth. Higher net sales in the Asia Pacific segment were due mainly to the increase in iPhone revenue primarily attributable to the strong demand for iPhone 4 and carrier expansion, strong sales of iPad, and increased sales of Macs. The Asia Pacific segment represented 21% and 13% of total net sales in 2011 and 2010, respectively. 

Net sales in Asia-Pacific increased $5.1 billion or 160% during 2010 compared to 2009. The significant growth in Asia-Pacific net sales was due mainly to increased iPhone revenue, which was primarily attributable to country and carrier expansion and continued growth from existing carriers. Asia-Pacific net sales were also favorably affected by strong demand for Mac portable and desktop systems and for iPad. Particularly strong year-over-year growth was experienced in China, Korea and Australia. The Asia-Pacific segment represented 13% and 7% of the Company&#146;s total net sales for 2010 and 2009, respectively. 

Retail 

Retail segment net sales increased $4.3 billion or 44% during 2011 compared to 2010. The increase in net sales was driven primarily by strong demand for iPad, higher sales of Macs, and an increase in iPhone revenue. The Company opened 40 new retail stores during 2011, 28 of which were outside the U.S., ending the year with 357 stores open compared to 317 stores at the end of 2010. As of September 24, 2011, the Company had a total of 245 U.S. retail stores and 112 international retail stores. 

During 2011, the Company had an average of 326 stores compared to an average of 288 stores during 2010. The average revenue per store increased 27% to $43.3 million in 2011 compared to $34.1 million in 2010. The Retail segment represented 13% and 15% of total net sales in 2011 and 2010, respectively. 

Retail net sales increased $3.1 billion or 47% during 2010 compared to 2009. The increase in net sales was driven primarily by strong demand for iPad, increased sales of Mac desktop and portable systems and a significant year-over-year increase in iPhone revenue. The Company opened 44 new retail stores during 2010, 28 of which were outside the U.S., ending the year with 317 stores open compared to 273 stores at the end of 2009. With an average of 288 stores and 254 stores opened during 2010 and 2009, respectively, average revenue per store increased to $34.1 million in 2010, compared to $26.2 million in 2009. The Retail segment represented 15% and 16% of the Company&#146;s total net sales in 2010 and 2009, respectively. 

The Retail segment reported operating income of $3.3 billion during 2011 compared to $2.4 billion during 2010. The year-over-year increase in Retail operating income was primarily attributable to higher overall net sales that resulted in significantly higher average revenue per store during 2011 compared to 2010. The Retail segment reported operating income of $1.7 billion during 2009. The increase in Retail operating income during 2010 compared to 2009 was attributable to higher overall net sales. 

Expansion of the Retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in fixed assets and related infrastructure, operating lease commitments, personnel, and other operating expenses. Capital asset purchases associated with the Retail segment since inception totaled $2.8 billion through the end of 2011. As of September 24, 2011, the Retail segment had approximately 36,000 full-time equivalent employees and had outstanding lease commitments associated with retail space and related facilities of $2.4 billion. The Company would incur substantial costs if it were to close multiple retail stores and such costs could adversely affect the Company&#146;s financial condition and operating results.

The gross margin percentage in 2010 was 39.4% compared to 40.1% in 2009. This year-over-year decline in gross margin was primarily attributable to new products that had higher cost structures, including iPad, partially offset by a more favorable sales mix of iPhone, which had a higher gross margin than the Company average. 

The Company expects to experience decreases in its gross margin percentage in future periods, as compared to levels achieved during 2011, largely due to a higher mix of new and innovative products with flat or reduced pricing that have higher cost structures and deliver greater value to customers, and potential future component cost and other cost increases. 

The foregoing statements regarding the Company&#146;s expected gross margin percentage are forward-looking and could differ from anticipated levels because of several factors including, but not limited to certain of those set forth below in Part I, Item 1A, &#147;Risk Factors&#148; under the subheading &#147; Future operating results depend upon the Company&#146;s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities ,&#148; which is incorporated herein by reference. In general, gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product transitions and potential increases in the cost of components, as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the Company&#146;s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. In response to these competitive pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company&#146;s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. Due to the Company&#146;s significant international operations, financial results can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates. 

Operating Expenses

R&#38;D expense increased $647 million or 36% to $2.4 billion in 2011 compared to 2010. This increase was due primarily to an increase in headcount and related expenses to support expanded R&#38;D activities. Although total 

&#160; 

R&#38;D expense increased 36% during 2011 compared to 2010, it declined slightly as a percentage of net sales, due to the 66% year-over-year growth in the Company&#146;s net sales during 2011. 

R&#38;D expense increased 34% or $449 million to $1.8 billion in 2010 compared to 2009. This increase was due primarily to an increase in headcount and related expenses in the current year to support expanded R&#38;D activities. Also contributing to this increase in R&#38;D expense in 2010 was the capitalization in 2009 of software development costs of $71 million related to Mac OS X Snow Leopard. Although total R&#38;D expense increased 34% during 2010, it declined as a percentage of net sales given the 52% year-over-year increase in net sales in 2010. 

The Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&#38;D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the Company&#146;s core business strategy. As such, the Company expects to make further investments in R&#38;D to remain competitive. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expense (&#147;SG&#38;A&#148;) 

SG&#38;A expense increased $2.1 billion or 38% to $7.6 billion during 2011 compared to 2010. This increase was due primarily to the Company&#146;s continued expansion of its Retail segment, increased headcount and related costs, higher spending on professional services and marketing and advertising programs, and increased variable costs associated with the overall growth of the Company&#146;s net sales. 

SG&#38;A expense increased $1.4 billion or 33% to $5.5 billion in 2010 compared to 2009. This increase was due primarily to the Company&#146;s continued expansion of its Retail segment, higher spending on marketing and advertising programs, increased share-based compensation expenses and variable costs associated with the overall growth of the Company&#146;s net sales.

The year-over-year increase in other income and expense during 2011 was due primarily to higher interest income and net realized gains on sales of marketable securities. The overall decrease in other income and expense in 2010 compared to 2009 was attributable to the significant declines in interest rates on a year-over-year basis, partially offset by the Company&#146;s higher cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances. Additionally the Company incurred higher premium expenses on its foreign exchange option contracts, which further reduced the total other income and expense. The weighted average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 0.77%, 0.75% and 1.43% during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company had no debt outstanding and accordingly did not incur any related interest expense. 

Provision for Income Taxes 

The Company&#146;s effective tax rates were approximately 24.2%, 24.4% and 31.8% for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company&#146;s effective rates for these periods differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 

&#160; 

35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. 

As of September 24, 2011, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $3.2 billion, and deferred tax liabilities of $9.2 billion. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of a valuation allowance. 

The Internal Revenue Service (the &#147;IRS&#148;) has completed its field audit of the Company&#146;s federal income tax returns for the years 2004 through 2006 and proposed certain adjustments. The Company has contested certain of these adjustments through the IRS Appeals Office. The IRS is currently examining the years 2007 through 2009. All IRS audit issues for years prior to 2004 have been resolved. In addition, the Company is subject to audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities. Management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company&#146;s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management&#146;s expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.

&#160; $ 37,529 &#160; &#160; $ 18,595 &#160; &#160; $ 10,159 &#160; ##TABLE_END Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased $30.6 billion or 60% during 2011. The principal components of this net increase was the cash generated by operating activities of $37.5 billion, which was partially offset by payments for acquisition of property, plant and equipment of $4.3 billion, payments for acquisition of intangible assets of $3.2 billion and payments made in connection with business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $244 million. The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months. 

The Company&#146;s marketable securities investment portfolio is invested primarily in highly rated securities and its policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company&#146;s investment policy requires investments to generally be investment grade with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. As of September 24, 2011 and September 25, 2010, $54.3 billion and $30.8 billion, respectively, of the Company&#146;s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. 

Capital Assets 

The Company&#146;s capital expenditures were $4.6 billion during 2011, consisting of approximately $614 million for retail store facilities and $4.0 billion for other capital expenditures, including product tooling and manufacturing 

&#160; 

process equipment, real estate for the future development of the Company&#146;s second corporate campus, and other corporate facilities and infrastructure. The Company&#146;s actual cash payments for capital expenditures during 2011 were $4.3 billion, of which $612 million relates to retail store facilities. 

The Company anticipates utilizing approximately $8.0 billion for capital expenditures during 2012, including approximately $900 million for retail store facilities and approximately $7.1 billion for product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and corporate facilities and infrastructure, including information systems hardware, software and enhancements. 

During 2012, the Company expects to open about 40 new retail stores, approximately three-quarters of which will be located outside of the U.S. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations 

The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the Company has financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to the Company. 

The following table presents certain payments due by the Company under contractual obligations with minimum firm commitments as of September 24, 2011 and excludes amounts already recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet (in millions):

&#160; ##TABLE_END Lease Commitments 

The Company&#146;s major facility leases are typically for terms not exceeding 10 years and generally provide renewal options for terms not exceeding five additional years. Leases for retail space are for terms ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of September 24, 2011, the Company&#146;s total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $3.0 billion, of which $2.4 billion related to leases for retail space. 

Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Component Suppliers 

The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company&#146;s products and to perform final assembly and test of finished products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. As of September 24, 2011, the Company had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of $13.9 billion. 

&#160; 

Other Obligations 

Other outstanding obligations were $2.4 billion as of September 24, 2011, and were comprised mainly of commitments under long-term supply agreements to make additional inventory component prepayments and to acquire capital equipment, commitments to acquire product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and commitments related to advertising, research and development, Internet and telecommunications services and other obligations. 

The Company&#146;s other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets consist primarily of deferred tax liabilities, gross unrecognized tax benefits and the related gross interest and penalties. As of September 24, 2011, the Company had non-current deferred tax liabilities of $8.2 billion. Additionally, as of September 24, 2011, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $1.4 billion and an additional $261 million for gross interest and penalties classified as non-current liabilities. At this time, the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in connection with these tax liabilities; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table. 

Indemnification 

The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third-party. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of end-users of its operating system or application software for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. The Company did not record a liability for infringement costs related to indemnification as of either September 24, 2011 or September 25, 2010. 

The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. However, the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations, and payments made under these agreements historically have not been material.
