Find the deployed app's link here : https://analysis-of-10k-fillings.streamlit.app/

And you can find the code in master's branch, a little walkthorough for the jupyter notebooks, the notebook task1.ipynb contains code for automation of downloads and task_final.ipynb contains merging and cleaning of data, and the geneartimg results and insights through inference 

And regarding my assumptions, as you can see in the app I have followed the rules mentioned in the assignment, I have choosen among the generated insights and I have provided the reasonings for them
Whereas coming to the analysis section, I strictly followed and visualized the information generated by LLM, as much information LLM gave was repetitive and some of which couldn't't be visualized, I have choosen few informationa and analysis it has given and visualized them.

Right now, I have only done the work for 'Apple Company', I ll soon update for other companies as well.(At the time of application, I did not know I would be having a deadline over the next days, so I had little time managing my end-sems and this assignment, but still I tried to give my best - Thank you)
